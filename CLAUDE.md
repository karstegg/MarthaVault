# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üö® **CRITICAL FOR CLAUDE-CODE REVIEWERS** üö®
**If you are reviewing daily production reports (JSON/Markdown in `daily_production/`), you MUST:**
1. **Request source WhatsApp data file path FIRST**
2. **Verify 3+ data points against source before any other review**
3. **NEVER approve without source data verification**
4. **See detailed requirements in Section 10.1 below**

**Data accuracy is MORE IMPORTANT than technical compliance for operational reports.**

  settings: |-
    {
      "model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
      "maxSessionTurns": 15,
      "autoAccept": ["list_directory", "read_file", "write_file", "glob"],
      "telemetry": {"enabled": false}
    }
```

### **Key Technical Discoveries**
1. **‚ùå WRONG**: `gemini_model` parameter (unsupported) ‚Üí **‚úÖ RIGHT**: Model in `settings` JSON
2. **‚ùå WRONG**: `@v0` GitHub Action ‚Üí **‚úÖ RIGHT**: `@v0.1.11` for proper tool support  
3. **‚ùå WRONG**: 5 session turns ‚Üí **‚úÖ RIGHT**: 15 turns for multi-site processing

## 1 Identity & Operating Modes
You are **Greg's back-office AI assistant**.

**User**: Gregory (Greg) Karsten - Senior Production Engineer, Underground Mining Sites
You run inside this Obsidian vault via **Claude Code**.

| Mode | Trigger | Behaviour |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Default (AUTONOMOUS)** | Any natural-language prompt | Analyse intent ‚Üí decide folder, filename, tags, links ‚Üí create/edit files. |
| **Command (EXECUTOR)** | A slash-command (`/task`, `/triage`, etc.) | Ignore inference; run the exact instructions in the matching file under .claude/commands/. |

After every operation, reply with a one-line confirmation: *"Created `projects/Pump_123/2025-07-29 ‚Äì Kick-off.md` (#meeting #Pump_123)."*

---
## 2 Folder Policy
`00_inbox/`            # drop-zone for raw notes
`projects/`            # one sub-folder per project (create on demand)
`tasks/`               # holds master_task_list.md
`people/`              # one note per person
`personal/`            # non-work related items (home, finance, etc.)
`reference/`           # reference materials, org charts, team directory
`reference/locations/` # mine sites, company locations, operational areas
`reference/equipment/` # equipment databases, fleet specifications
`media/`               # attachments (Obsidian default path)
`media/audio/`         # audio recordings and transcriptions
`media/image/`         # screenshots, photos, diagrams
`media/documents/`     # PDFs, invoices, contracts
`daily_production/`    # daily mine production reports (dual format)
`daily_production/data/` # JSON database files for analysis

- If no folder is obvious, place the file in `00_inbox/`.
- When a project or person first appears, create the needed sub-folder or note.

---
## 3 File-Naming & Front-Matter
**Filename format:** `YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äì Descriptive Title.md`

Every new file starts with:
```

Status:: #status/new Priority:: #priority/medium Assignee:: DueDate::

```
Populate any fields you can infer (assignee, priority, due date).

---
## 4 Tagging Rules
1. Always add one **primary tag**
   - Meeting ‚Üí #meeting
   - Task ‚Üí #task
   - Idea ‚Üí #idea
   - Decision ‚Üí #decision
2. Add `#year/2025`.
3. Infer extra tags from content (project names, systems, mine shafts, etc.).
4. Maintain `/tags.md` as the canonical list; append new tags there when you invent one.

---
## 5 Task Management
- Mirror every Markdown check-box into `tasks/master_task_list.md`.
- Keep checkbox state in sync both ways.
- If a task belongs to a person, create/link their note in `people/` and set `Assignee:: [[Person Name]]` in the task file.

---
## 6 Assignment Logic
- Detect phrases like "for Jane Smith", "John to‚Ä¶", "ask Bob to‚Ä¶".
- Add `Assignee:: [[<Person Note>]]`.
- If the person note does not exist, create `people/<Person Name>.md` with front-matter:
```

Role:: Started::

```

---
## 7 Permissions & Safety
- **Auto-accept** file create/move/edit operations.
- **Always ask** before deleting a file.
- Never overwrite an existing file; append a numeric suffix if the filename already exists.

---
## 8 Date & Time
Today's date is **2025-07-29**. Use it when a date is required and I haven't specified one.

---
## 9 Examples (for your internal reference)
> "Just had a meeting with Jane Smith about Pump 123.  She'll draft the inspection checklist by Friday.  High priority."

1. Create meeting note in `projects/Pump_123/` or `people/` folder.
 - Example Filename: `2025-07-29 ‚Äì Meeting with Jane Smith re Pump 123.md`
 - Tags: #meeting #Pump_123
 - Links: [[Jane Smith]], [[projects/Pump_123/]]
2. Create task note.
 - Example Filename: `2025-07-29 ‚Äì Jane Smith - Draft Inspection Checklist.md`
 - Tags: #task #priority/high #Pump_123
 - Front-Matter: `DueDate:: 2025-08-01`
3. Add task line to `tasks/master_task_list.md`.

*(Examples are illustrative; follow the rules above.)*

---
## 9 Slash Commands Available
The following commands are implemented in `.claude/commands/`:

- **`/task $ARGUMENTS`** - Appends task to `tasks/master_task_list.md` with `#task` and `#year/2025` tags
- **`/triage`** - Processes all files in `00_inbox/`, moving them to appropriate folders based on content analysis
- **`/new-note $ARGUMENTS`** - Creates structured notes with automatic project folder placement and tagging
- **`/nn $ARGUMENTS`** - Alias for `/new-note`
- **`/pdr $ARGUMENTS`** - Process Daily Reports: Converts WhatsApp production reports to structured JSON/Markdown format (uses parallel agents for multiple reports)
- **`/pdr-cloud $ARGUMENTS`** - Autonomous cloud-based daily production report processing using Claude
- **`/pdr-gemini $ARGUMENTS`** - Autonomous cloud-based daily production report processing using FREE Gemini 2.5 Flash

## 10 Common Operations

### Daily Production Reporting System
Located in `daily_production/` folder with dual format:
- **Markdown Reports**: `YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äì [Site] Daily Report.md` (human-readable)
- **JSON Database**: `data/YYYY-MM-DD_[site].json` (machine-readable for analysis)

#### Mine Sites & Engineers
- **Nchwaning 2**: [[Johan Kotze]] (GES TMM Underground, acting for [[Sikilela Nzuza]] on leave)
- **Nchwaning 3**: [[Sello Sease]]
- **Gloria**: [[Sipho Dubazane]]
- **Shafts & Winders**: [[Xavier Peterson]] (infrastructure focus)

#### Reporting Timeline & Dating Logic
- **Reports received**: Morning of Day X (e.g., 30th July 06:30-07:30)
- **Data content**: Previous day's performance (e.g., 29th July operations)
- **Shift readiness**: Current day preparation (e.g., 30th July shift status)
- **File naming**: Use report date (when received), not data date

**CRITICAL DATING RULE**: 
- **Report Date**: Day when report received (e.g., 19/08/2025)
- **Data Date**: Previous day's operations (e.g., 18/08/2025)
- **Example**: Report received 19th August morning contains 18th August production data

#### Report Processing Workflow
1. **Receive WhatsApp reports** from engineers each morning
2. **Auto-detect multiple reports** and launch parallel processing when applicable:
   - **Single report**: Process directly with main `/pdr` agent
   - **Multiple reports**: Deploy specialized parallel agents for concurrent processing:
     - `pdr-nchwaning2`: Nchwaning 2 reports (Johan Kotze)
     - `pdr-nchwaning3`: Nchwaning 3 reports (Sello Sease)
     - `pdr-gloria`: Gloria reports (Sipho Dubazane)
     - `pdr-shafts-winders`: Infrastructure reports (Xavier Peterson)
3. **Parse content** into structured JSON format capturing:
   - Safety status and incidents
   - Production metrics (ROM, Product, Decline, Loads, Blast)
   - Equipment availability and breakdowns
   - Silo levels (Gloria), Dam levels (S&W), Ore pass levels (S&W)
4. **Create readable Markdown** with analysis and issue highlighting
5. **Cross-reference** equipment codes using `equipment_codes.md`
6. **Track trends** and identify critical performance issues
7. **Follow up** on missing reports or operational crises
8. **Mandatory data validation**: All processed reports must include source validation section

#### Equipment Code Validation & BEV Classification
Reference `daily_production/equipment_codes.md` for:
- TMM codes: DT (Dump Truck), FL (Front Loader), HD (Haul Truck), RT (Roof Bolter), SR (Service Rig), UV (Utility Vehicle)
- Specialized: GD (grader), DZ (dozer), LD (delivery vehicles)
- Watch for common errors: GR should be GD

**CRITICAL EQUIPMENT CORRECTION**:
- **RT = Roof Bolter** (NOT Rock Truck - no such equipment exists)
- This is specified in equipment database and must be consistent

**Equipment Database**: `reference/equipment/brmo_fleet_database.json`
- Complete fleet inventory with BEV/diesel classification
- **BEV Equipment**: Epiroc MT 42 B (DTs) and ST14 B (FLs) - all at Nchwaning 3
- **Diesel Equipment**: CAT AD 30/45 (DTs) and Epiroc ST14 (FLs) - all sites
- Use for automated BEV vs diesel analysis in daily reports

#### **CRITICAL: Data Validation Requirements** üö®
**Effective immediately, all daily production reports must comply with:**

**For Gemini (Processing Agent):**
- **NEVER INVENT DATA**: Extract only actual values from source WhatsApp data
- **Source validation required**: Every report must include `source_validation` section with:
  ```json
  {
    "source_validation": {
      "field_name": {
        "value": [extracted_value],
        "source_line": [line_number],
        "source_quote": "[exact_text_from_source]",
        "confidence": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW|NONE"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Missing data protocol**: If data not in source, use `null` - DO NOT fabricate
- **Self-verification**: Quote 3 random data points from source before submitting

**For Claude-Code (Review Agent):**

**üö® CRITICAL: Before reviewing ANY daily production report, you MUST understand these requirements:**

#### **MANDATORY REVIEW PROTOCOL FOR CLAUDE-CODE**

**PHASE 0: Site Identification Verification (CRITICAL FIRST)**
1. **Verify engineer-site mapping**: Confirm engineer assignments match known site mappings
2. **Check sender validation**: Verify WhatsApp sender ID matches claimed engineer if available
3. **Flag ambiguous identification**: Question any site assignment that lacks clear evidence
4. **Cross-reference patterns**: Compare production data patterns with historical site data
5. **Validate headers**: Ensure site identification was explicit in source message or properly inferred

**PHASE 1: Source Data Verification (REQUIRED SECOND)**
1. **Request source file access**: Always ask for the original WhatsApp data file path
2. **Demand data traceability**: Request line numbers for ALL major production figures
3. **Cross-reference verification**: Pick 3 random data points and verify against source
4. **Mathematical validation**: Check that totals and calculations are accurate
5. **Red flag detection**: Question any "perfect" percentages or unrealistic values

**PHASE 2: Technical Compliance Review**
6. **Schema validation**: Check JSON structure against established patterns
7. **File organization**: Verify folder structure follows `YYYY-MM/DD/` hierarchy
8. **Repository standards**: Confirm front-matter, tagging, and naming conventions
9. **Documentation quality**: Assess markdown formatting and readability

**CRITICAL FAILURE PREVENTION:**
- **NEVER approve without source verification** - even if technically perfect
- **Data accuracy is MORE IMPORTANT than schema compliance**
- **When in doubt, request the original WhatsApp source data**
- **Operational data impacts real mining decisions - treat seriously**

#### **MANDATORY CHECKLIST (ALL MUST PASS):**
```markdown
‚ñ° Source file path provided and verified
‚ñ° 3+ data points cross-checked against source  
‚ñ° Mathematical calculations validated
‚ñ° No invented/fabricated numbers detected
‚ñ° Production figures trace to specific source lines
‚ñ° Equipment data matches source exactly
‚ñ° Technical schema follows repository patterns
‚ñ° File structure uses correct hierarchy
‚ñ° Front-matter and tagging complete
‚ñ° Documentation clear and professional
```

#### **APPROVAL CRITERIA:**
- **APPROVE**: Only when BOTH data integrity AND technical compliance pass
- **REQUEST CHANGES**: If any data cannot be traced to source
- **REJECT**: If fabricated data detected or source verification impossible

#### **COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR:**
- Production numbers that seem "too perfect" or rounded
- Equipment availability percentages without source backing
- Data that cannot be traced to specific WhatsApp lines
- Mathematical inconsistencies in totals
- Claims of "comprehensive data" without source validation

**Remember: You are reviewing OPERATIONAL DATA that impacts real mining operations. Data accuracy is critical for business decisions.**

#### **LESSON FROM PR #7 FAILURE:**
**Previous Claude-Code review FAILED by:**
- Approving fabricated ROM production (15,670t when source showed 5,545t)
- Never requesting source data verification
- Giving 5-star approval to 185% inflated numbers  
- Focusing only on technical compliance, ignoring data accuracy
- Treating operational data like code rather than business intelligence

**This failure could have led to incorrect operational decisions. NEVER repeat this mistake.**

**Validation Script:**
Use `scripts/validate-daily-report.ps1` to verify data accuracy before approving any PR.

### Task Management
- All checkbox tasks must be mirrored in `tasks/master_task_list.md`
- Task priority levels: urgent (üî¥), high (üü°), medium (üü¢)
- Due dates trigger priority classification

### File Organization
- Use `00_inbox/` for quick capture, then triage to proper folders
- Projects get their own subfolder under `projects/`
- Person mentions auto-create entries in `people/`
- Daily production reports in dedicated `daily_production/` structure

### Link Management
- Use `[[Person Name]]` for people references
- Use `[[projects/Project_Name/]]` for project folder links
- Daily reports link to JSON data files for analysis
- Maintain bidirectional linking between related files

- **N3 Active**: `120363204285087803@g.us` (Live production reports)
- **Report Times**: 4:00-6:00 AM SAST (not 6:00-8:30 AM)

**Essential Commands:**
```bash
# 24/7 Service Management (RECOMMENDED)
cd /workspaces/MarthaVault/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge
./start-bridge-service.sh start    # Start with monitoring
./start-bridge-service.sh status   # Check if running
./start-bridge-service.sh restart  # Restart if issues
./start-bridge-service.sh monitor  # Manual monitoring mode

# Manual Bridge Start (LEGACY - use service instead)
cd /workspaces/MarthaVault/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge && go run main.go

# Check live data
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT timestamp, substr(content, 1, 100) FROM messages ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Query production messages  
sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT timestamp, chat_jid, substr(content, 1, 100) FROM messages WHERE content LIKE '%ROM%' OR content LIKE '%Product%' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 3;"
```

**For GitHub Actions Automation:**
- **SSH into Codespace** and query SQLite directly
- **No MCP tools needed** - use standard SQL queries
- **Database path**: `/workspaces/MarthaVault/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge/store/messages.db`

### üîÑ **Backup & Restore Codespace Setup**

**Critical Files to Preserve:**
- `whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge/store/messages.db` (authentication + data)
- `whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge/main.go` (bridge executable)
- `whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-mcp-server/whatsapp_sqlite_extractor_final.py` (data extractor)

**Quick Backup Commands:**
```bash
# Backup authentication and data
gh codespace ssh -- "cd /workspaces/MarthaVault && tar -czf whatsapp-backup.tar.gz whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge/store/"

# Verify Go version in Codespace

```bash
# 1. Clone repository in new Codespace
git clone https://github.com/karstegg/MarthaVault.git /workspaces/MarthaVault

# 2. Restore backup if available
tar -xzf whatsapp-backup.tar.gz

# 3. Start bridge
cd /workspaces/MarthaVault/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge && go run main.go
```

**Recovery Documentation**: See `WHATSAPP_MCP_COMPLETE_SETUP.md` for full setup if backup unavailable

### üö® **CRITICAL BRIDGE CONNECTIVITY ISSUE (2025-08-14)**

**Issue Discovered**: WhatsApp bridge WebSocket connections drop during inactivity periods, causing missing production reports during automated processing.

**Timeline & Impact**:
- **August 13, 2025**: `/pdr-cloud today` workflow found zero messages despite engineers confirming reports were sent 7:30-8:30 AM SAST
- **Root Cause**: Bridge service shuts down during inactivity periods (overnight/weekends)
- **Business Impact**: Missing daily production reports, failed autonomous processing workflows

**Investigation Results**:
- Bridge was running when checked, but had restarted automatically 
- WebSocket connections to WhatsApp Web drop after extended idle periods
- Manual `go run main.go` requires constant connection maintenance
- Production report time window (4:00-6:00 AM SAST) often occurs during bridge downtime

**Solution Implemented**: 24/7 Service Management
- **Service Script**: `/workspaces/MarthaVault/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge/start-bridge-service.sh`
- **Features**: Start, stop, restart, monitor, status functions
- **Auto-Restart**: Detects bridge failures and restarts automatically
- **Health Checks**: 5-minute monitoring intervals with failure detection
- **Background Operation**: Runs independently of terminal sessions

**Integration with Cloud Processing**:
- **Bridge Health Check**: Workflow now checks bridge status before processing
- **Auto-Restart**: Automatically starts bridge if not running
- **Early Exit**: Stops processing with informative message if no data found
- **Status Validation**: Confirms bridge operation before data extraction

**Prevention Strategy**:
- Use service management script instead of manual `go run main.go`
- Monitor bridge health in all automation workflows
- Implement "no data found" early exit to avoid blank report processing
- Regular bridge connectivity verification in production workflows

## 14 Gemini AI File Creation Breakthrough - ‚úÖ TECHNICAL SUCCESS

### üéØ **CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH (2025-08-17)**
**Successfully solved Gemini AI file creation in GitHub Actions!**

- **Authentication**: PAT with codespace scope  
- **Target**: Codespace `cuddly-guacamole-496vp6p46wg39r`
- **Database**: `/workspaces/MarthaVault/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge/store/messages.db`
- **Output**: GitHub Actions artifacts with extracted data

### üìä **Production Workflow Status**

**Current Capability**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Tested**: July 6, 2025 data extraction
- **Results**: 28 production messages extracted successfully  
- **Performance**: 15-30 seconds execution time
- **Success Rate**: 100% after PAT implementation

**Working Workflow**: `.github/workflows/july6-test-simple.yml`

### üõ†Ô∏è **Usage Instructions**

**To Trigger Automation:**
1. Add label `test-extraction` to any issue
2. Workflow automatically activates Codespace
3. Extracts WhatsApp production data for specified date range
4. Uploads results as downloadable artifacts

**Example SQL Query Structure:**
```sql
SELECT timestamp, chat_jid, sender, substr(content, 1, 100) 
FROM messages 
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2025-07-06 00:00:00+00:00' AND '2025-07-06 23:59:59+00:00' 
AND (content LIKE '%ROM%' OR content LIKE '%Production%' OR content LIKE '%Gloria%' OR content LIKE '%Nchwaning%' OR content LIKE '%S&W%') 
ORDER BY timestamp;
```

### üîß **Troubleshooting**

**Common Issue**: "HTTP 404: Not Found" for Codespace
- **Cause**: Missing `codespace` scope in token
- **Solution**: Use PAT with `codespace` scope, not `GITHUB_TOKEN`

**üö® CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED (2025-08-14)**: WhatsApp Bridge Connection Drops
- **Symptom**: Bridge stops capturing messages during inactivity periods
- **Impact**: Missing production reports during processing workflows
- **Root Cause**: WebSocket connection drops when bridge idle for extended periods
- **Detection**: No data found when reports should exist (engineers confirmed sending reports)
- **Solution**: Implemented 24/7 service monitoring with automatic restart capabilities

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Test Codespace connectivity
gh codespace list
gh codespace ssh -c "cuddly-guacamole-496vp6p46wg39r" -- echo "test"

# Verify WhatsApp database
gh codespace ssh -c "cuddly-guacamole-496vp6p46wg39r" -- ls -la /workspaces/MarthaVault/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge/store/
```

## üö® CRITICAL DATA QUALITY MEMORIES 

### **DATING ERROR MEMORY (2025-08-19)**
**NEVER FORGET**: Reports show PREVIOUS DAY's production data, not same-day data.

**Critical Dating Rule**:
- **Report received**: 19/08/2025 morning (report date)
- **Data content**: 18/08/2025 operations (data date)
- **Common error**: Setting data_date = report_date instead of report_date - 1 day

**Example Fix**: Report received 19th August contains 18th August production data.

### **EQUIPMENT CODE MEMORY (2025-08-19, REINFORCED 2025-08-22)**
**NEVER FORGET**: RT = Roof Bolter (NOT Rock Truck - no such equipment exists)

**Critical Equipment Codes**:
- **RT = Roof Bolter** (roof bolting equipment) - CRITICAL: NO ROCK TRUCKS EXIST!
- **DT = Dump Truck** (material transport)
- **FL = Front Loader** (loading equipment)
- **HD = Hydraulic Drill** (drilling equipment, NOT haul truck)
- **SR = Scaler** (scaling equipment, NOT service rig)

**RECURRING ERROR ALERT**: This RT=Rock Truck error occurred AGAIN on 2025-08-20 Nchwaning 2 report. MANDATORY validation required for ALL equipment references.

### **SITE MISIDENTIFICATION MEMORY (2025-08-16)**
**NEVER FORGET**: WhatsApp messages without site headers cause incorrect site identification in autonomous processing.

**Critical Site Misidentification Case Study - August 16, 2025:**
- **Error**: Message from Sikilela Nzuza (N2) incorrectly processed as "Nchwaning 3" with "Sello Sease"
- **Root Cause**: 10:47:35 WhatsApp message had NO site identifier ("N2", "N3", etc.)
- **Group Chat Limitation**: All messages show same group JID, individual sender IDs not mapped
- **AI Failure**: Content analysis guessed wrong site instead of flagging ambiguous message
- **Impact**: Nearly caused operational confusion and missing N3 report detection failure

**Engineer-to-Site Mapping (CRITICAL REFERENCE):**
- **N2 (Nchwaning 2)**: Sikilela Nzuza (primary) / Johan Kotze (acting when on leave)
- **N3 (Nchwaning 3)**: Sello Sease / Stef Lourens
- **Gloria**: Sipho Dubazane
- **S&W**: Xavier Peterson

**Sender ID Mapping (When Available):**
- **278575940939844**: Sikilela Nzuza (N2) - **CONFIRMED 2025-08-16**
- **219064991522977**: Sikilela Nzuza (N2) - **CONFIRMED 2025-08-18** (Weekend maintenance reports)
- **265033925812455**: Sello Sease (N3) - **CONFIRMED 2025-08-18** (From morning N3 report)
- **134144797478985**: Sipho Dubazane (Gloria) - **CONFIRMED 2025-08-18** (From morning Gloria report)
- **150800697426058**: Xavier Peterson (S&W) - **CONFIRMED 2025-08-18** (From morning S&W report)

**MANDATORY VALIDATION PROTOCOL:**
1. **Always verify site identification** when processing autonomous reports
2. **Flag ambiguous messages** that lack clear site headers
3. **Map sender IDs to engineers** when possible  
4. **Cross-reference production data patterns** with known site characteristics
5. **Never guess** - mark as "REQUIRES_MANUAL_REVIEW" if uncertain

**Prevention Measures:**
- **Enforce site headers**: Request engineers use "N2:", "N3:", "Gloria:", "S&W:" prefixes
- **Sender mapping database**: Build WhatsApp sender ID ‚Üí engineer mapping
- **Validation enhancement**: Auto-flag messages missing site identification
- **Manual review queue**: Route ambiguous messages for human verification

**This error could have led to incorrect operational decisions and missed safety reports - NEVER allow unvalidated site guessing again.**

### **OPERATIONAL CONTEXT MEMORY (2025-08-22)**
**NEVER FORGET**: Production operations context for daily report language and priorities

**Critical Language Guidelines**:
- **RESERVE "Critical/Extreme"** for genuine emergencies only (fires, evacuations, safety incidents)
- **Avoid hyperbolic language** for normal operational variations
- **Below-target production ‚â† critical failure** - use measured language

**Silo Levels Context (Gloria)**:
- **NOT a critical daily parameter** for UG Mining Department monitoring
- **Low silo levels = NORMAL operations** (ore flowing to surface plant)  
- **High silo levels = PRODUCTION CONCERN** (surface plant bottleneck, UG standstill risk)
- **Trend analysis required** - only concerning if consistently high/low over week periods
- **Daily reports**: Treat as informational metric, NOT critical alert
- **User perspective**: UG Mining Department (UG plant + TMM operations under Greg's oversight)

**Reporting Tone**:
- Measured, professional operational language
- Context-aware criticality assessment
- Reserve urgent language for genuine safety/operational emergencies

## üö® CRITICAL BRIDGE CONNECTIVITY MEMORY (2025-08-14)
**NEVER FORGET**: WhatsApp bridge service shuts down during inactivity periods, causing missing production reports.

**Key Memory Points:**
- **Always check bridge health FIRST** before any WhatsApp data queries
- **Bridge service location**: `/workspaces/MarthaVault/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge/start-bridge-service.sh`
- **Service commands**: `./start-bridge-service.sh start|status|restart|monitor`
- **Critical timing**: Production reports sent 4:00-6:00 AM SAST, bridge often down overnight
- **Detection pattern**: Zero messages found when engineers confirm reports were sent
- **Solution**: Use service management script, NOT manual `go run main.go`
- **Integration**: All cloud processing workflows now include automatic bridge health checks
- **Early exit**: Workflows stop with notification if no data found (prevents blank reports)

**Emergency Recovery Process**:
1. SSH into Codespace: `gh codespace ssh -c "cuddly-guacamole-496vp6p46wg39r"`
2. Check status: `cd /workspaces/MarthaVault/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-bridge && ./start-bridge-service.sh status`
3. Start if needed: `./start-bridge-service.sh start`
4. Monitor: `./start-bridge-service.sh monitor` (runs in background)
5. Verify data: Query SQLite for recent messages

**This issue cost us missing production reports - NEVER let bridge run without service management again.**
