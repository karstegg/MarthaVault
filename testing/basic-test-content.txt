Mining Operations Overview

Underground mining operations at Assmang's Black Rock facility involve three main sites: Gloria, Nchwaning 2, and Nchwaning 3. Daily production focuses on ROM (Run of Mine) extraction, with target production rates varying by site. Equipment includes Track Mounted Machines (TMMs) such as Dump Trucks (DT), Front Loaders (FL), Haulers (HD), Rock Trucks (RT), and Service Rigs (SR). Safety protocols require daily status reporting, with clear safety status being the target. Production engineers monitor equipment availability percentages and breakdown incidents to optimize operational efficiency. Each site reports production tonnage against daily targets, with load counts tracked by shift (day, afternoon, night). Infrastructure monitoring includes main fans, plant operations, and fire alarm systems.
