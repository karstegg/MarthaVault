# Rule: WhatsApp Messaging Protocol

## @Claude Direct Instructions
When you encounter a note containing `@Claude` followed by an instruction, treat this as a **DIRECT COMMAND**:

**Examples**:
- `@Claude Please send a WhatsApp message to...` ‚Üí Draft and request permission
- `@Claude Draft a response to...` ‚Üí Create draft for approval
- `@Claude Follow up on...` ‚Üí Take specified follow-up action

## WhatsApp Message Protocol (CRITICAL)
1. **ALWAYS** draft the message first
2. **ALWAYS** ask for permission before sending
3. **NEVER** send WhatsApp messages without user approval
4. When requested to write a WhatsApp message, compile a draft first and ask for permission

## WhatsApp Message Style Guide

Based on Greg's messaging patterns in Production Engineering and UG Eng Management groups:

### Message Structure
1. **Start with appropriate greeting**:
   - `Good day team` / `Good morning team` / `Good afternoon team` / `Good evening team`
   - `Gents,` (for management group)
   - Match time of day appropriately

2. **Message Body - Keep it**:
   - **Brief and direct** - no formalities or long explanations
   - **Action-oriented** - clear instructions or questions
   - **Professional but conversational**
   - **Context-specific** when needed

3. **No formal closings**:
   - No "Regards" or signatures
   - No "Thanks" unless acknowledging something specific
   - Use emojis sparingly (üëçüèº for acknowledgments)

### Communication Patterns by Audience
- **Production Engineering Group (Broader)**: Professional, brief questions with @mentions, include context
- **UG Eng Management (Direct Reports)**: More direct/informal, action-focused, quick status checks

### Examples of Greg's Style
- `@134144797478985, was the belt replacement completed successfully?`
- `Morning Sipho, please provide total blasts for yesterday.`
- `Gents, please assist SelloT to finalise the montly report`
- `Hi SK suspend license, + drugtest pending investigation, bakkie must be locked out and repaired`
- `Team, please update the presentation... we need to submit to DMR this afternoon`

### Message Drafting Guidelines
- Use @ mentions for specific people when needed
- Ask direct questions when seeking information
- Give clear, actionable instructions
- Include deadlines/urgency when relevant
- Keep technical content concise but specific
