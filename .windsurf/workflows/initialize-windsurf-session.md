description: Initialize a new Windsurf session with complete MarthaVault context
---

# /initialize-windsurf-session

**This workflow provides complete context when starting a new session in Windsurf.**

## What This Does

Loads and verifies:
1. ✅ MarthaVault identity and operating modes
2. ✅ MCP server connections (Graph Memory, Basic Memory, WhatsApp)
3. ✅ Pending tasks and inbox status
4. ✅ Critical reminders and protocols
5. ✅ Available workflows and commands

## Automatic Context Loading

**Already Active** (no action needed):
- ✅ **Rules** from `.windsurf/rules/` - Always loaded
  - `martha-vault-identity.md` - Your identity and operating modes
  - `whatsapp-messaging-protocol.md` - Message drafting rules
  - `memory-systems-usage.md` - Graph + Basic Memory guidelines
  - `file-organization-standards.md` - Folder structure and conventions

- ✅ **Memories** from Cascade - Automatically retrieved based on relevance
  - Critical configurations
  - Technical debt items
  - Context from previous sessions

- ✅ **MCP Servers** from `.mcp.json` - Shared with Claude Code CLI
  - Graph Memory: 348 entities (Personnel, Projects, Locations, etc.)
  - Basic Memory: Markdown files in organized folders
  - WhatsApp: Message sending and retrieval

## Session Verification

### 1. Check MCP Server Status

Verify all three MCP servers are connected:
- **memory** (Graph Memory) - Entity-relationship knowledge graph
- **basic-memory** - Semantic document search
- **whatsapp** - WhatsApp messaging integration

**How to check**: Look for MCP server indicators in Windsurf UI or run a test query:
```
Search for "Gregory Karsten" in Graph Memory
```

### 2. Check Pending Items

Review `00_Inbox/` for items needing triage:
- Unprocessed notes
- Media files
- Quick notes
- Urgent reminders

**Action**: Run `/triage` if inbox has items

### 3. Review Master Task List

Check `tasks/master_task_list.md` for:
- Urgent tasks (Priority: High)
- Overdue items
- Today's tasks

### 4. Check for @Claude Instructions

Scan recent notes for `@Claude` tags indicating direct instructions:
- WhatsApp messages to draft
- Follow-up actions needed
- Responses to prepare

## Available Workflows

**Core Operations**:
- `/triage` - Process all items in 00_Inbox/
- `/task [description]` - Add task to master list
- `/quick-note [content]` - Create quick note in inbox

**Communication**:
- WhatsApp messaging via MCP (always draft first, ask permission)

**Session Management**:
- `/initialize-windsurf-session` - This workflow (run at session start)

## Critical Reminders

### File Creation Protocol
- ❌ **NEVER** create files unless absolutely necessary
- ✅ **ALWAYS** prefer editing existing files
- ❌ **NEVER** proactively create documentation files
- ✅ Only create docs if explicitly requested

### WhatsApp Protocol
- ✅ **ALWAYS** draft messages first
- ✅ **ALWAYS** ask permission before sending
- ❌ **NEVER** send without user approval
- ✅ Follow Greg's messaging style (brief, direct, action-oriented)

### Memory Systems
- ✅ Use **Graph Memory** for quick entity lookups and relationships
- ✅ Use **Basic Memory** for semantic search and document retrieval
- ✅ Use **BOTH** in parallel for comprehensive context
- ✅ Update Graph Memory when new entities or relationships emerge

### Task Management
- ✅ All tasks must be in `tasks/master_task_list.md`
- ✅ Individual task files can exist in project folders
- ✅ Keep master list synchronized
- ✅ Use proper front matter and tags
