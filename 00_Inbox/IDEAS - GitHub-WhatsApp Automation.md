I have a few more ideas that I want to add to enhance my current GitHub Actions workflow for extracting WhatsApp information. Currently using it to extract daily reports from WhatsApp and formatting them in a Markdown as well as a JSON format. I want to utilize the framework to create a portal or a WhatsApp conversation thread.I want to send a message to myself, and in doing so, I would be talking directly to Claude on Github to do some things in the mouth of alt. Look for information, add pictures. I can upload things (voice notes, pictures, etc.), but I think we should start with just some text messages. This should go in the ideas section under personal.
