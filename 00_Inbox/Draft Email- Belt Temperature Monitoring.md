**SUBJECT:** Belt Temperature Monitoring - Expansion Planning

---

Gents,

From the Emergency Preparedness Meeting, we need to expand belt temperature monitoring across all 3 shafts sites. The core motivation is the fact that the DMPR now requires real time monitoring of bearing temperatures.

The N3 decline belt Bluetooth trial is performing very well. @Stef Lourens has all the technical info and system specs connected to the life online system.

Next step is expanding the trial to N3 decline tail section (working cost) to prove underground performance before full rollout.

@Sipho Dubazane @Sikelela Nzuza @Simon Sease, please identify priority belts in your areas for installation planning. Main capex is scheduled for Years 2-4, but you will have to request capex to be brought fwd.

@Pieter Swanepoel, please review

Regards
Greg
