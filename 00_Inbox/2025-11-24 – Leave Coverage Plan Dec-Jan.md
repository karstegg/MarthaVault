# Greg's Leave Coverage Plan - Dec 14, 2025 to Jan 15, 2026

**Leave Period**: December 14, 2025 - January 15, 2026 (33 days)
**Coverage Required**: Full operations coverage across 4 sites
**Critical Period**: Year-end + New Year + CAS L9 post-deadline monitoring

---

## Critical Context

**Q4 Priorities Active During Leave:**
- CAS Level 9: Dec 31 DMRE deadline (falls DURING leave)
- BEV Optimization: Fraser McGill study ongoing
- Production: N3 focus continues through year-end
- HD54 Fire: Actions monitoring post-investigation

**Organizational Structure:**
- **Direct Reports**: Sipho (Gloria), Sikelela (N2), Sello (N3), Xavier (S&W)
- **Reporting To**: Rudi Opperman (Operations Manager), dotted line to Jacques Breet (Engineering Manager)

---

## Coverage Strategy

### Option 1: Distributed Coverage by Site Engineers
**Pros**: Engineers already manage their sites, maintain continuity
**Cons**: No single point of coordination for cross-site issues

**Assignments**:
- **Sipho Dubazane** → Gloria operations + equipment
- **Sikelela Nzuza** → N2 operations + equipment
- **Sello Sease** → N3 operations + infrastructure (CRITICAL - production priority site)
- **Xavier Peterson** → S&W operations + shafts/winders

**Escalation**: Direct to Rudi Opperman or Jacques Breet for cross-site coordination

---

### Option 2: Acting Senior Production Engineer
**Pros**: Single point of coordination, maintains engineering leadership visibility
**Cons**: Requires briefing/handover prep

**Best Candidates**:
1. **Sello Sease** (N3) - If N3 production is priority focus
2. **Sikelela Nzuza** (N2) - Senior experience
3. **External**: Jacques Breet takes direct oversight

---

## Communication Plan

### Before Leave (Dec 13)

**Stakeholder Briefings**:

- [ ] Jacques Breet - Engineering priorities, CAS L9 status
- [ ] Site Engineers (Sipho, Sikelela, Sello, Xavier) - Individual site handovers
- [ ] Junior Engineers - Support expectations during Greg's leave
- [ ] OEM Contacts (Epiroc, CAT, Bell, etc.) - Coverage contact info

**Documentation Prepared**:
- [ ] CAS L9 status report (site-by-site)
- [ ] Open projects tracker
- [ ] Equipment critical items list
- [ ] Capital projects status
- [ ] Vendor contact list with coverage assignments

---

### During Leave (Dec 14 - Jan 15)

**Emergency Contact**:
- Greg available for: _________________ (Critical escalations only? Completely offline?)

**Escalation Path**:
1. Site Engineer (Sipho/Sikelela/Sello/Xavier)
2. Acting Coverage Person (if assigned)
3. Rudi Opperman (Operations)
4. Jacques Breet (Engineering)

**Weekly Check-ins** (Optional):
- Coverage person sends brief email update to Greg? (Or full offline?)

---

### Return (Jan 16, 2026)

**Priority Debriefs**:
- [ ] CAS L9 post-deadline status (Did we make Dec 31? DMR response?)
- [ ] BEV optimization progress
- [ ] Production performance (especially N3)
- [ ] Equipment failures/major issues
- [ ] Capital project progress
- [ ] Personnel updates (new hires onboarded?)

---

## Decision Points

**Greg to decide:**
1. **Coverage model**: Distributed (site engineers direct to Rudi/Jacques) vs. Acting SPE?
2. **Acting SPE candidate** (if applicable): Sello? Sikelela? Jacques direct?
3. **Emergency contact availability**: Completely offline vs. critical escalations only?
4. **Junior Engineers role**: Can they provide coverage support or still too new?
5. **CAS L9 ownership**: Who signs off on Dec 31 deadline completion in your absence?

---

## Actions Required

**This Week (Nov 24-28)**:
- [ ] Decide coverage model and acting person (if applicable)
- [ ] Discuss with Rudi and Jacques

**Week of Dec 2-6**:
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of coverage plan
- [ ] Begin handover documentation prep
- [ ] Confirm Junior Engineers availability/capability

**Week of Dec 9-13** (Final week before leave):
- [ ] Complete all handover briefings
- [ ] Finalize CAS L9 status report
- [ ] Document all open projects/critical items
- [ ] Set out-of-office messages with coverage contacts
- [ ] Final check-in with Rudi/Jacques/site engineers

---

## Notes

**33-day leave over year-end** crosses major milestones:
- CAS L9 Dec 31 deadline (17 days into leave)
- Christmas shutdown period (likely reduced operations Dec 24-Jan 1?)
- New year ramp-up (Jan 2-15 while still on leave)

**Risk**: CAS L9 deadline falls during leave. Ensure ownership crystal clear before Dec 14.

**Opportunity**: Junior Engineers may be onboarded by Dec 14 - can they provide support capacity?
