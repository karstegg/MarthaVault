OK, so this should go to the Ideas section. I'm thinking WhatsApp is a very nice tool to engage, communicate with a coding assistant or LLM. So using it to send messages, notes to Cloud Code, and even attachments, getting responses back, feedback, but also getting back decision points like in GitHub. So Mckay Wrigley posted a video where he explained how to use Cloud Code with Obsidian. And he mentioned using WhatsApp, setup WhatsApp for automation as an MCP. So yeah, I am busy trying to get that done, although it is still running locally. Ideally you'd want it all to be running in the cloud so that you don't have to have your laptop running also.
