## 📅 Meetings
- [ ] Teams meeting with Nerospec and [[Hennie Van Niekerk]] just discussing the progress of the 2x upgrades phase one has started to have some problems with the PDUs. Transerve is coming to site to come and assist. Problems seem to be that there is a shattering or clicking inside the pdu box even if the isolator is off so that's why [[Transerve]] will come to assist .The second phase will be the alternator upgrade so yeah that will also start in earnest. Breakdown this has been coming down but most of the issues will be resolved with these two upgrades the 2nd point is that the timelines will be updated at some later point once you know In terms of level 9 limitation the upgrades plus level 9 will be done together. I requested [[Hennie Van Niekerk]] to make sure that the changes to the system are captured as part of change management and relevant documentation  & sign off.
