## Meeting Notes & Action Items

### 1. Real-Time Temperature Monitoring via Belt Scales
- [ ] Identify which belts currently have temperature sensors applied #task #priority/high 📅 2025-11-15
- **Context:** Need to determine current sensor coverage across belt systems
- **Critical:** Sensors must not be applied to areas that do not require them

### 2. Capex for BEV Bay Firedoor Project
- [ ] Add sensors to Capex budget for BEV bay firedoor project #task #priority/high #BEV #fire-safety 📅 2025-11-15

### 3. BEV Fire DDOPS Requirements
- [ ] BEV fire DDOPS must include CO sensors #task #priority/high #BEV #fire-safety 📅 2025-11-15
- **Critical Safety Requirement:** Carbon monoxide detection essential for BEV fire scenarios

### 4. Mine Arc Maintenance Training Program
- [ ] Develop Mine Arc Maintenance Training program #task #priority/medium 📅 2025-11-30
  - Master plan required
  - Job plans needed
  - OEM specifications required
- **Note:** Comprehensive training framework needed for emergency refuge chambers

### 5. Surface Air Compressor SCADA Integration
- [ ] Link surface air compressors to SCADA system via underground reticulation #task #priority/high 📅 2025-11-22
- **Requirement:** Must be able to monitor pressure remotely
- **Follow-up:** Assign to [[Pieter, Unknown]] (need to confirm surname)

## Context & Background

**Emergency Preparedness Focus Areas:**
- Real-time monitoring systems for fire detection
- BEV-specific safety infrastructure (Li-Ion battery fire risks)
- Emergency refuge equipment maintenance
- SCADA integration for remote monitoring
- CO sensor requirements for lithium battery fires

**Related Projects:**
- [[projects/BEV/]] - Battery Electric Vehicle implementation
- Fire safety systems across all sites
- SCADA monitoring expansion

**Key Safety Concerns:**
- BEV fire scenarios require CO monitoring (different from traditional mining fires)
- Temperature monitoring on conveyor belts (early fire detection)
- Emergency refuge chamber reliability

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (This Week):**
   - Survey current belt temperature sensor deployment
   - Add sensor capex line items to BEV project budget
   - Update BEV fire DDOPS documentation with CO sensor requirements

2. **Medium-Term (This Month):**
   - Develop Mine Arc training program framework
   - Complete SCADA integration for surface compressors

3. **Follow-Up Required:**
   - Confirm Pieter's full name and assign SCADA task
   - Coordinate with BEV project team on sensor integration
   - Review OEM specifications for Mine Arc equipment
