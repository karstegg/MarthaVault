Thoughts / Remembering priorities from last week:

## ✅ Tasks

- [ ] Capture weekly charts
- [ ] Follow up re SA Cranes VO for 6 months extension by Emile (Central procurement)

## 📝 Notes
- **CAS Project:** Lots of work still to do, especially smaller OEMs (BELL, Aard, Manitou, Fermel)
  - OEMs submitted plans - must review together with projects planner
  - Related: advert for appointment of junior project engineers

## 📅 Meetings
- [ ] Discussion with [[Lorenzo Julius]] re LTI (2 weeks ago)
  - Fixed term electrician - pinkie finger injury packing fan starter box in store
  - Unnecessary event - discussion around incident
- [ ] **BEV vent doors** - must be sorted this week
- [ ] **BEV Bay 2 minisub** - follow up with Lourens (capital meeting item)
  - Mdu finding estimates to finalize capital approvals
  - Question: Can we bypass contract process? (minisub already bought for Bay 1 - different non-standard size)
  - Amount: >R2m (triggers contract requirement, adds 1 month + lead time issues)
