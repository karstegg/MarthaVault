Good day,

We urgently need further assistance on DT0121.

We have already replaced the proximity switches and also swapped the MC24 controller with one from another working machine, however the gear selection issue still persists.

The Barloworld technician is currently on site and has tested all relevant pressures and the park brake circuit. All tests were found to be within specification.

Please assist with the technician to attend to the problem.

Also please quote:
- Complete harness
- Proximity switches
- Programmed MC24 Controller

Thank you
