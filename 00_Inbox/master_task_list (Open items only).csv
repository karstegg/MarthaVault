Operations,"Set up BaaS battery availability measurement system Chris Ross Rahab Makolomakwa - Mail sent to Chris Ross, Ronnie, and Phillip to start tracking",In?Progress,medium,"Chris Ross, Rahab Makolomakwa",#task #BaaS #battery #availability #year/2025,Nchwaning3,BEV battery performance montiroing,"Although this is not linked to a specific project per se, it is linked to the BEV battery performance. It is linked to the monthly invoices for rental of the BEV batteries. At the moment we get an availability percentage number from Epiroc. There are some conditions attached to that:
1. They are penalized for lower availability
2. We pay for availability above a certain threshold so, but we are not actually capturing the availability on our side, they are reporting only from their side. So I've asked Chris and Rahab to implement this system. So that I can compare our numbers against the reported numbers from Epiroc before we pay any invoices. "
