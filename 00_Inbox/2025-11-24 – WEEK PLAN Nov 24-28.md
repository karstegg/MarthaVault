## 💡 STRATEGIC NOTES

**Tuesday is make-or-break for CAS L9.** If any OEM can't commit to pre-Christmas completion, you know by Tuesday EOD and can escalate immediately Wed/Thu.

**Leave coverage has 3-week runway.** Initial conversation this week (Rudi/Jacques), detailed planning next week (Dec 2-6), final handover week of Dec 9-13.

**Production focus at N3** visible in belt projects, infrastructure, decline delays - maintain momentum through site engineer coordination.

**Junior Engineers timing** - if offers go out Monday, onboarding could start next week, giving 2 weeks runway before your leave.

---

**Week 48 Focus:** Execute CAS L9 coordination, lock in timeline confidence, initiate leave coverage planning.
