## 📊 EFFORT ANALYSIS

**Quick Wins (Short Tasks):**
- 9 items can be completed in hours/days
- High impact, low effort
- Priority: Clear these first to free capacity
- Examples: Email follow-ups, scope submissions, decisions

**Medium Effort (1-2 Weeks):**
- 13 items requiring focused work periods
- Mix of technical fixes, surveys, coordination
- Need dedicated time blocks but not full projects
- Examples: Equipment repairs, contract routing, compliance items

**Long-Term Projects (Weeks-Months):**
- 9 strategic initiatives requiring project management
- Capital projects, infrastructure upgrades, recruitment
- Need planning → approval → execution → commissioning
- Examples: Belt optimization, battery chargers, chute replacement

**Effort Distribution:**
- SHORT: 29% of tasks (9/31)
- MEDIUM: 42% of tasks (13/31)
- LONG: 29% of tasks (9/31)

**Strategy:**
1. **This Week**: Focus on SHORT tasks to clear backlog
2. **Next 2 Weeks**: Execute MEDIUM items in parallel
3. **Ongoing**: Keep LONG projects moving through stages

**Capacity Planning:**
- SHORT tasks: ~3-4 days total effort
- MEDIUM tasks: ~15-20 days total effort (distributed)
- LONG projects: ~3-6 months ongoing (managed, not executed daily)

**Before Leave (Dec 14):**
- Complete ALL SHORT tasks (9 items)
- Close 80% of MEDIUM tasks (10/13 items)
- Ensure LONG projects have clear owners and milestones

**Risk Items (Overdue MEDIUM):**
- Lubri Vent installation
- Belt temp sensor survey
- DMR drill torque actions
- Lifting equipment analysis
- Need immediate attention to prevent further slippage
