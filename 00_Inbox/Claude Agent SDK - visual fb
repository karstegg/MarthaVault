Visual feedback
When using an agent to complete visual tasks, like UI generation or testing, visual feedback (in the form of screenshots or renders) can be helpful. For example, if sending an email with HTML formatting, you could screenshot the generated email and provide it back to the model for visual verification and iterative refinement. The model would then check whether the visual output matches what was requested.

For instance:

Layout - Are elements positioned correctly? Is spacing appropriate?
Styling - Do colors, fonts, and formatting appear as intended?
Content hierarchy - Is information presented in the right order with proper emphasis?
Responsiveness - Does it look broken or cramped? (though a single screenshot has limited viewport info)
Using an MCP server like Playwright, you can automate this visual feedback loop—taking screenshots of rendered HTML, capturing different viewport sizes, and even testing interactive elements—all within your agent's workflow.
