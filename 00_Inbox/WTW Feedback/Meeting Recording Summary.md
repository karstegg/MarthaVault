Here is a summary of the WTW audit feedback meeting, detailing the key findings, action items, and opportunities for improvement discussed by the auditors.

### **Overall Summary**

The audit feedback was presented as a collaborative discussion, highlighting both areas of excellence and opportunities for improvement. The auditors commended the team for the exceptionally good standard of electrical maintenance across the sites. Key areas identified for action include enhancing safety protocols and monitoring for the new Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) fleet, addressing the structural integrity of concrete reservoirs, and systematically resolving findings related to fire protection systems and component storage.

### **1. Key Findings & Action Items by Topic**

#### **A. Risk Control & Systems** (Auditor: Dean)

*   **Key Finding:** Several existing risk controls, such as inspections and additional training, have proven effective, as evidenced by high equipment uptime (>85%).
*   **Opportunity for Improvement:** The Risk Control Profile should be updated to re-classify these controls from "partially effective" to "fully effective" to accurately reflect their performance.
*   **Action Item:** Ensure that all equipment used for ultrasonic inspections has current SANAS-accredited calibration.

#### **B. Concrete & Structural Integrity** (Auditor: Martin)

*   **Key Finding:** The 3-megalitre concrete reservoir shows significant signs of degradation, including multiple cracks, spalling concrete, and exposed rebar, posing a long-term structural risk. The underground blend tank also has considerable water seepage.
*   **Action Items:**
    1.  Place all concrete reservoirs on a Planned Preventative Maintenance (PPM) schedule.
    2.  Conduct baseline measurements of existing cracks and monitor them every 3-6 months to track propagation and determine the urgency of repairs.
    3.  Investigate and repair the cause of water seepage in the blend tank.
*   **Discussion Point:** The team confirmed that a full structural audit, including both steel and concrete, is already planned for the year. Martin offered to share a concrete repair standard (based on Gautrain/Sika standards) to assist the team.

#### **C. Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) Management** (Auditor: Marius)

*   **Key Finding:** The fire extinguishers supplied for lithium-ion battery fires lack clear, specific certification for that application. The product is certified for Class A & B fires, which is different.
*   **Action Item:** Obtain technical certification from the supplier to confirm the extinguisher's suitability and efficacy for lithium-ion battery fires.
*   **Key Finding (Risk):** The response plan for a BEV fire must account for the highly toxic smoke and the ineffectiveness of handheld extinguishers against a fire inside the steel battery casings.
*   **Opportunity for Improvement:** The primary emergency response for a BEV fire should be **immediate evacuation** of the area, not direct firefighting by general employees. This needs to be clearly communicated.
*   **Key Finding:** BEV charging bays have inadequate ventilation. While monitoring of BEVs is comprehensive during operation, the system is "blind" when units are static or on charge.
*   **Action Items:**
    1.  Proceed with the planned project to install extraction ventilation in the charging bay, ensuring fire-rated partitioning is used.
    2.  Implement the planned monitoring systems for static and charging BEVs to provide full oversight.

#### **D. Fire Protection & Electrical Systems**

*   **Key Finding (Thermography):** Three critical high-resistance faults were identified on electrical isolators, creating significant hotspots (Delta T >160Â°C). These are located on the 78Y Main Consumer Substation and the Y85 MCC.
*   **Action Item:** Immediately attend to and repair these critical high-resistance faults. (Auditor: Final Speaker)
*   **Key Finding:** Breakers in the Main Substation 36 are obsolete, with no spare parts available. This presents a major operational risk, as resets require manual intervention.
*   **Action Item:** Proceed with the planned replacement of the obsolete breakers with the assistance of Schneider, scheduled for September. (Auditor: Dean / Team)
*   **Key Finding:** The earth-proving device for diesel filling at T3 is installed but not interlocked with the pump, meaning it doesn't prevent operation if an earth is not present.
*   **Opportunity for Improvement:** Interlock the device to the pump/valve start circuit to ensure it functions as a preventative control. (Auditor: Dean)
*   **Key Finding:** A new BTU unit in the main sub has significant battery acid build-up, indicating a potential battery or charging fault.
*   **Action Item:** Investigate the root cause of the acid build-up and rectify it. (Auditor: Dean)
*   **Key Finding:** The fire-stopping seal at a wall penetration in the T2 underground main substation is incomplete, compromising the fire barrier.
*   **Action Item:** Reseal the wall penetration using an approved fire-rated material (e.g., Hilti foam). (Auditor: Jonathan)

#### **E. General Site Safety & Housekeeping**

*   **Key Finding:** Unsafe practices were observed, including diesel filling without wheel chocks and a vehicle's articulation pin not being engaged, indicating a need for reinforced awareness.
*   **Action Item:** Reinforce operator training and pre-use inspection discipline. (Auditor: Dean)
*   **Key Finding:** New conveyor belts in the main store are being stored incorrectly (laid flat on the floor), which can cause damage.
*   **Opportunity for Improvement:** Implement correct storage procedures using stands or frames. Discuss the possibility of the supplier (Dunlop) providing these stands. (Auditor: Dean)
*   **Key Finding:** Electrical junction boxes on spare motors in the stores are left open, creating a risk of dust ingress and rodent damage.
*   **Action Item:** Ensure all junction boxes on stored equipment are properly closed and sealed. (Auditor: Dean)
*   **Key Finding:** Deluge valve systems under conveyors are being damaged by material spillage.
*   **Opportunity for Improvement:** Install protective canopies over these critical valve stations. (Auditor: Jonathan)
