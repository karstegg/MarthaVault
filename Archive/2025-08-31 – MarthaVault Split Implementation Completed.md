# IDEA - Split MarthaVault ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (August 2025)

## Original Idea
Split the daily_production reports from MarthaVault and make it its own vault.

## Implementation Result
Successfully separated production data from the productivity workspace:
- **MarthaVault**: Now focused on productivity, task management, and workspace organization
- **ProductionReports**: Separate repository for production data, automation, and reporting

## Architecture Achieved
- Complete separation of concerns
- Production automation moved to dedicated repository
- Workspace remains clean and focused on productivity
- Both repositories have their own CLAUDE.md configurations
