## MSTA Fire Consultants
Update: Just spoke to Henk Erasmus (He is the Independent Consultant from MSTA that will be doing the audits on all TMM fire suppression systems)  He is on his way he's now about hour and a half to two hours away from here so he want me to arrange a permission slip for his camera and then also arrange the people from Kenru Fire (Our contracted Vendor that installs and maintains our fire suppression systems on all our mobile equipment (TMM)) that they are available to accompany him on his audit so that they can assist him but also to repair any problems that he finds. His colleague Gerard will be joining him tomorrow he is traveling tomorrow morning so it will be here tomorrow that are on the same time this time and assist him with the audits.
I must also remind Marina every Friday that they access must be renewed.
