# 2025-09-22 â€“ Daily Note

What are monthly BaaS invoices, we must set up a system to measure battery availability. I'm thinking of assigning this to [[Chris Ross]] and [[Rahab Makolomakwa]]. 

## Capital Projects FB meeting
- Compliance bay - capex?
- Old Belts 51H 52, 53, 54 belts (old 9-west conveyor belts) - [[Rudi Opperman]] to provide fb (email sent)
- Confirm with [[Sello Sease]], who must drive Dedicated Development Capital TMM. (Mine Planning or Mine Management) 
- complete vote closures

## Week ahead
- you must follow up on the rental unit and follow up on the S2 order with [[Marothi]].  (@Claude, please use Whatsapp - draft a message and send me a message for me to confirm)
- Capex for illumination - get more information from everyone.
- SA Cranes. Have forwarded to [[Jomari]] and [[Lourens van der Heerden]]. Must draw up contract with required changes
- BEV battery availability must be logged as assets. - Sent a mail to all

## Discussion with [[Rudi Opperman]]
- We will make a decision regarding the appointment of [[Shane]] into the position of short engineer.
- Other than that, we can consider [[Neo]] as the candidate, as she is on par with the other candidate. She is also a woman that can give Engineering department some color
- We also discussed. The appointment of two junior engineers must write a memo and then advertise for a two-year fixed-term contract.
