## Recommendations

1. **Implement Email Flagging System**
   - Currently 0 flagged emails - consider flagging high-priority items for follow-up
   - Suggested: Flag emails requiring decisions, signatures, or critical action

2. **Reduce Unread Count**
   - 11 unread (5.4%) is reasonable, but 3 from Jacques (20+ days) should be processed
   - Process the 4 oldest unread items first

3. **Email Management**
   - Archive automatic replies and notification emails immediately
   - Process signature requests same day

4. **Communication Pattern**
   - Jacques Breet: 82 emails (very high volume) - consider delegating or filtering
   - Most senders have 0% unread rate (good processing)
