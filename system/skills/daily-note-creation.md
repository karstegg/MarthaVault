Morning:
  Create Daily Note â†’ Review Inbox (/triage) â†’ Check Master Task List
                â†“
  Update Strategic Focus (FocusOfWeek.md) â†’ Prioritize Tasks

Evening:
  Update Daily Note â†’ Mark Tasks Complete â†’ Archive Completed Items
                â†“
  Plan Tomorrow's Priorities â†’ Update Strategy if Needed
```

**Memory System Integration**:
