# Skill Card: Inbox â†’ Triage Workflow

**Skill Name**: `inbox-triage`
**Trigger**: `/triage` command OR inbox items present (00_inbox/ folder)
**Confidence Threshold**: 0.75
**Success Rate**: TBD (Phase 3 tracking)

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Read Inbox Items
```
Tool: Glob("00_inbox/*.md")
Action: List all unprocessed files in inbox
```

### Step 2: Analyze Content
For each file:
- Read file content
- Identify content type (meeting, task, idea, decision, person, project)
- Assess urgency (deadline mentions, "URGENT", priority keywords)
- Extract key entities (people names, project names, site names)
- Determine organizational context

### Step 3: Apply Tags
Add front-matter if missing:
```yaml
---
Status:: Draft
Priority:: (Low|Med|High|Critical)
Assignee:: (inferred from content)
DueDate:: (if mentioned)
Tags:: #year/2025 #<primary-tag> #site/<name> #<project>
---
```

**Primary Tag Rules**:
- Meeting mentions/outcomes â†’ `#meeting`
- Action items/to-do â†’ `#task`
- Concepts/future possibilities â†’ `#idea`
- Approval/commitment/choice â†’ `#decision`

**Site Tag Rules**:
- "Nchwaning 2" | "N2" â†’ `#site/Nchwaning2`
- "Nchwaning 3" | "N3" â†’ `#site/Nchwaning3`
- "Gloria" â†’ `#site/Gloria`
- "Shafts & Winders" | "S&W" â†’ `#site/S&W`

### Step 4: Create Wikilinks
Scan for:
- **People**: Names â†’ Create `[[Lastname, Firstname]]` links
  - Check if person file exists in people/
  - Create stub if missing
- **Projects**: Project keywords â†’ Create `[[projects/ProjectName/]]` links
  - Check if project folder exists
  - Create folder structure if missing
- **Places**: Site mentions â†’ Create `[[reference/places/SiteName]]` links

### Step 5: Standardize Filename
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD â€“ Descriptive Title.md`
- Use date from content or today's date
- Create descriptive title (3-7 words)
- Handle duplicate filenames (append _2, _3, etc.)

### Step 6: Move to Appropriate Folder
**Routing Logic**:
```
Meeting notes â†’ Schedule/ (if future event) OR people/ (if person-specific)
Tasks â†’ tasks/ (if standalone) OR projects/ (if project-specific)
Ideas â†’ IDEAS/
Decisions â†’ projects/ (context-dependent)
People info â†’ people/
Project updates â†’ projects/[ProjectName]/
Equipment/technical â†’ Operations/ or reference/
```

### Step 7: Extract Actionable Tasks
Scan for action items:
- Lines starting with `- [ ]` (checkbox)
- Phrases: "need to", "must", "action:", "follow up", "TODO"
- Deadline mentions: "by Friday", "end of month", "ASAP"

For each task found:
- Add to `tasks/master_task_list.md`
- Format: `- [ ] Task description #tags ðŸ“… YYYY-MM-DD`
- Include assignee, priority, project link

---

âœ… **File Successfully Triaged**:
- Front-matter complete with all required fields
- At least one primary tag applied
- Site tag if applicable
- Filename standardized (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Wikilinks created for people/projects/places
- File moved from 00_inbox/ to appropriate folder
- Action items extracted to master_task_list.md

## Confidence Scoring Factors

**High Confidence (â‰¥0.75)**:
- Clear content type (meeting, task, etc.)
- Obvious folder destination
- Known people/project names
- Standard date format present

**Low Confidence (<0.75)**:
- Ambiguous content type
- Multiple possible destinations
- Unknown entities (new people/projects)
- Missing critical context

**Action on Low Confidence**:
- Ask user for clarification
- Provide options with rationale
- Learn from user choice for future

---

## Learning Integration (Phase 3)

Track user edits after triage:
- Which folder assignments get changed?
- Which tags get added/removed?
- Which wikilinks get corrected?
- Patterns to strengthen/decay

**Feedback Loop**:
```
User Edit â†’ Pattern Recognition â†’ Confidence Adjustment
     â†“              â†“                    â†“
  Deviation    Update Skill Card    Future Improvement
```
