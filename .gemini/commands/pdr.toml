Execute the Daily Production Report (PDR) workflow. You must adhere to the detailed logic outlined in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Primary Workflow:**
1.  **Detect Input**: Check if report text is provided as an argument. If not, scan the `00_inbox/` for new production reports.
2.  **Handle Multiple Reports**: If multiple reports are found in the inbox, initiate parallel processing by invoking the specialized agents (pdr-nchwaning2, pdr-gloria, etc.) as described in the Claude constitution. Your role is to act as the orchestrator.
3.  **Parse Content**: For each report, parse all required data points (Safety, Production, Equipment, Breakdowns, Site-Specific data like Silo levels).
4.  **Validate Data**: Cross-reference equipment codes against `daily_production/equipment_codes.md` and flag any errors or missing information.
5.  **Generate Dual Output**:
    -   **JSON File**: Create a machine-readable JSON file in `daily_production/data/` with the structured data.
    -   **Markdown File**: Create a human-readable Markdown report in `daily_production/` that summarizes performance and links to the JSON data.
6.  **Assign and Tag**: Assign the correct engineer to the report and apply all relevant tags.
7.  **Confirm Completion**: Output a confirmation message summarizing the action, e.g., "âœ… Processed Gloria report for 2025-07-30 and created dual-format output."
