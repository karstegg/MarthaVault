```
Final Priority = (Base Priority √ó Strategy Multiplier) + FocusBoost
```

**Example**:
- Task: "Review charger quote"
- Base Priority: 0.75
- Strategy Multiplier: 1.5 (BEV Program)
- FocusBoost: +0.5 (Focus of Week)
- **Final Priority**: (0.75 √ó 1.5) + 0.5 = **1.625** (very high priority this week)
