# HD0054 Engine Repair Report

**Date**: 2025-08-13
**Equipment**: HD0054
**Vendor**: Deutsch Diesel Power

## 1. Overview

This report details the maintenance work carried out on the HD0054 drill rig engine between May 13th and May 29th, 2025. The work was performed by Deutsch Diesel Power in response to multiple engine error codes and starting issues.

## 2. Downtime Summary

- **Total Downtime**: 16 days (2025-05-13 to 2025-05-29)

## 3. Fault Finding & Resolution

### Evolution of Fault Finding

1.  **2025-05-13**: Initial investigation pointed to a faulty EGR and fuel pressure sensor.
2.  **2025-05-14**: Error code 2061 (AFC) was triggered. The EGR value was not responding, leading to a suspicion of a faulty ECU.
3.  **2025-05-25**: The engine was not starting. The low pressure sensor and rail pressure were identified as issues, and the high-pressure pump was marked for replacement.
4.  **2025-05-27**: The EGR and Rail were replaced, but a "water in fuel" error persisted.
5.  **2025-05-28**: The engine was still not starting. The fuel pump, fuel rail, and injectors were replaced.
6.  **2025-05-29**: A final EGR error code on the ECU led to the replacement of the ECU itself, which was then loaded with the correct hex file.

### Final Resolution

The issue was fully resolved by replacing the following components:
- EGR Valve
- Fuel Rail
- Fuel Pump
- Injectors
- ECU
