# Memorandum

Senior Production Engineer - Gregory Karsten  
Manager Human Resources - Thuli Gxotelwa

**RE: Create New Position: N3 Underground Electrical Foreman (Construction & Infrastructure)**

---

Thank you for the continued support in optimizing our electrical operations across the sites.

We would like to request a new position: **N3 Underground Electrical Foreman (Construction & Infrastructure)**.

## Background:

At Nchwaning 3, we are experiencing significant delays in production advance and infrastructure development due to our single-foreman electrical structure being unable to manage both breakdown response and planned construction activities across a 3-4km operational diameter.

The current foreman and crew must handle:
- **70+ minisubs, 350+ gulley boxes, 140 fans, 50 pumps** requiring legal inspections and maintenance
- **Breakdown response** across 3 production sections, 1 development section, 12 drill rigs, 12 roofbolters
- **Forward moves** for power, lighting, leaky feeder, and blasting boxes
- **Infrastructure installation** for minisubs, gulley boxes, fans, pumps, and 10km+ of lighting
- **Workshop support** for L&H, D&B, UV sections, and BEV Bay

When breakdowns occur (which is daily), the crew must abandon planned construction work to respond. This results in:
1. **Production delays** - Development sections cannot advance without power and lighting
2. **Compliance risks** - Legal inspections delayed when crew diverted to breakdowns
3. **Safety concerns** - Single UV operator for entire 3-4km spread creates access bottlenecks
4. **Planning disruption** - Forward moves and installations postponed repeatedly

## Solution Proposal:

We propose:
1. **Appoint 1x Foreman (Construction & Infrastructure)** to manage a dedicated construction crew
2. **Restructure existing crew** into two specialized teams:
   - **Construction Crew** (new foreman): 1x Chargehand, 1x Electrician, 1x Semi-Skilled, 1x UV Operator, 5x Cable Attendants
   - **Breakdown Crew** (existing foreman): 1x Chargehand, 4x Electricians, 4x Semi-Skilled
3. **Define clear responsibilities:**
   - Construction crew handles forward moves, installations, infrastructure PMs
   - Breakdown crew handles equipment repairs, services, urgent response
4. **Target start date:** January 2026

**Additional headcount required:**
- 1x Foreman (Construction & Infrastructure)
- 2x Electricians (additional for breakdown crew)
- 2x Semi-Skilled (additional for breakdown crew)
- No additional Cable Attendants or UV Operator (reallocated from existing crew)

## Spin-Offs:

The gains from this structure are:
- **Production enablement** - Construction schedule maintained independent of breakdowns
- **Compliance assurance** - Dedicated crew for planned legal inspections and infrastructure PMs
- **Safety improvement** - Each crew has UV operator, better supervision across geographical spread
- **Operational efficiency** - Parallel operations (breakdowns + construction), reduced context switching
- **Organizational resilience** - No single point of failure, succession planning, crew specialization

Please consider this request as critical for maintaining production advance, legal compliance, and operational safety at N3. The current single-foreman model has reached capacity limits with our infrastructure scale and production demands.

We look forward to your favorable response. Thank you.
