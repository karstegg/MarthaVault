# Memorandum: Create Additional Position - N3 Underground Electrical Foreman

**From:** Senior Production Engineer - Gregory Karsten

**RE: Create Additional Position: Nchwaning 3 Underground Electrical Foreman**

---

## Background

At Nchwaning 3 we are experiencing operational constraints in the Underground Electrical Section due to inadequate supervisory capacity for the current infrastructure scale and production support requirements.

The section currently operates with a single Foreman managing:
- 70+ Minisubs (distribution substations)
- 350+ Gulley boxes (local distribution points)  
- 140 Fans (ventilation systems)
- 50 Submersible pumps (dewatering)
- 10+ km LED lighting infrastructure
- 3-4 km operational diameter
- 3 Production sections + 1 Development section
- 12 Drill rigs + 12 Roofbolters
- Multiple fixed plant installations (tips, conveyors, crusher, screens)
- 3 Workshop sections (L&H, D&B, UV) + BEV Bay

The factors that contribute to this constraint are as follows:

1) The single Foreman must manage both reactive breakdown response and proactive infrastructure installation/expansion
2) Legal compliance inspections (substations, minisubs, conveyors, pumps, gulley boxes, 6-month e/l tests) compete with production support requirements
3) Infrastructure expansion projects (forward moves, minisub installations, lighting, leaky feeder) are delayed by unplanned breakdown events
4) Single UV operator creates access bottlenecks across the 3-4km operational spread
5) Inadequate supervision capacity for the geographical scale and asset base creates safety and compliance risks

## Solution Proposal

We propose:

1) That 1 x Underground Electrical Foreman (Construction & Infrastructure) is appointed to manage forward infrastructure projects, minisub installations, and planned maintenance
2) Initiate a process to Grade this Position concurrently to ensure the correct Level is assigned
3) This will allow the existing Foreman to focus on breakdown response, production support, and legal compliance inspections
4) Restructure the current crew into two specialized teams:
   - **Construction Crew:** 1 Electrician, 1 Semi-Skilled, 1 UV Operator, 5 Cable Attendants (NEW FOREMAN)
   - **Breakdown Crew:** 1 Chargehand, 4 Electricians, 4 Semi-Skilled (EXISTING FOREMAN)

## Spin-Offs

The gains from doing this are to have a more focused Underground Electrical team where:
- Construction and infrastructure expansion can proceed on schedule without disruption from breakdown events
- Breakdown response capacity is not compromised by competing construction priorities  
- Legal compliance inspections receive adequate supervisory attention across the 70+ minisubs and 350+ gulley boxes
- Production advance is not delayed by electrical infrastructure bottlenecks
- Safety risks are reduced through better supervision across the 3-4km operational diameter
- Organizational resilience is improved with no single point of failure in electrical supervision

Please consider this in a positive manner for the sustainability of safety and health as well as the morale of the Employees of BRMO while being more productive.

In conclusion, this request is considered from being headcount conscious, but with the opportunity to stabilize the BRMO Community and ensure adequate supervisory capacity for the current infrastructure scale.

We look forward to your favourable response. Thank you.
