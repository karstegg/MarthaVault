# Equipment Indexing Status - 2025-10-10

## Summary

**Goal**: Index all 154 equipment units from Current Production Fleet Inventory into Graph Memory for searchability.

**Current Status**: **1 of 154 units indexed (0.6%)**

**Working**: UV0105 ✅ (Water Bowser at Gloria)
**Not Yet Indexed**: 153 remaining units including DT109, DT118, FL082, RT0047, SR0024, etc.

---

## What Happened Today

### Root Cause Analysis

When you asked "Where is UV0105?", the memory search failed because:

1. **File created but not synced**: `Current Production Fleet Inventory.md` was created 2025-10-09 but `.sync-pending.txt` wasn't committed
2. **Checkpoint stale**: Memory systems never received the update signal
3. **Manual intervention**: We had to commit `.sync-pending.txt` and manually index entities

### Work Completed

✅ **Committed `.sync-pending.txt`** with 9 pending files
✅ **Indexed high-level documents**: Current Production Fleet Inventory, Capital TMM Tracker, Capital TMM Replacement Plan
✅ **Manually indexed UV0105**: Created entity for testing/demonstration
✅ **Extracted all 154 equipment** from Excel with proper site/type/model data
✅ **Created automated indexing script**: `index_equipment.py` for future use
✅ **Prepared 16 batches** of equipment entities ready for MCP processing

### What's Working Now

```bash
# This works:
mcp__memory__search_nodes("UV0105")
# Returns: Water Bowser, Seco UV100, Gloria Mine

# This doesn't work yet:
mcp__memory__search_nodes("DT109")
# Returns: [] (empty - not indexed)
```

## Why Only 1 of 154 Units is Indexed

**The Issue**: Vault sync process should automatically extract equipment entities from the markdown file and index them, but this requires:

1. **Structured data in markdown** OR
2. **Custom extraction logic** in the sync script OR
3. **Manual batch processing** via MCP tools

**Current Situation**: The `Current Production Fleet Inventory.md` file contains equipment data in **tables and summary lists**, but NOT as individual structured entries that the automated sync can parse.

**Solution Options**:

### Option A: Manual MCP Batch Processing (Recommended for Now)
Use the prepared batch files to manually index all equipment via MCP tools.

**Time Required**: ~15-20 minutes
**Files Ready**: `equipment_batches/batch_01.json` through `batch_16.json`

**Process**:
```python
# For each batch file (1-16):
with open('equipment_batches/batch_XX.json') as f:
    entities = json.load(f)

# Then use MCP tool:
mcp__memory__create_entities(entities)
```

### Option B: Enhanced Vault Sync Script (Long-term Solution)
Modify `.claude/commands/sync-vault-internal.md` to include equipment extraction logic when processing `Current Production Fleet Inventory.md`.

**Time Required**: 1-2 hours development + testing
**Benefit**: Automatic indexing on future updates

### Option C: Restructure Markdown File
Break down `Current Production Fleet Inventory.md` into 154 individual equipment files in `reference/equipment/` folder.

**Time Required**: ~30 minutes
**Benefit**: Standard vault sync handles it automatically
**Drawback**: 154 individual files vs 1 consolidated document

## Equipment Distribution

**By Site**:
- **N3**: 77 units (50%)
- **N2**: 62 units (40%)
- **Gloria**: 15 units (10%)

**By Category**:
- **Production TMM**: 110 units (dump trucks, LHDs, roof bolters, drills, scalers)
- **Support TMM**: 44 units (charging UVs, scissor lifts, RoRos, manlifts, water bowsers, etc.)

**Sample Equipment**:
- DT109 (Dump Truck, Epiroc MT42, N3)
- FL082 (LHD, Epiroc ST14, N3)
- RT0047 (Roof Bolter, Epiroc 235H, N3)
- UV0105 (Water Bowser, Seco UV100, Gloria) ✅ **INDEXED**

## Files Created During This Session

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `equipment_group1.json` - `equipment_group6.json` | 6 processing groups (~30 entities each) | ✅ Ready |
| `equipment_batches.json` | All 16 batches combined | ✅ Ready |
| `all_equipment_entities.json` | Single file with all 154 entities | ✅ Ready |
| `temp_equipment.json` | Intermediate extraction | ✅ Complete |
| `index_equipment.py` | Automated indexing script | ✅ Ready to use |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today if time permits):

1. **Run batch indexing script**:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\10064957\My Drive\GDVault\MarthaVault"
   python index_equipment.py
   ```

2. **Manually process batches** via Claude Code MCP:
   - Load each `equipment_batches/batch_XX.json` file
   - Use `mcp__memory__create_entities` tool
   - Process all 16 batches

3. **Verify indexing**:
   ```bash
   mcp__memory__search_nodes("DT109")  # Should return Dump Truck at N3
   mcp__memory__search_nodes("FL082")  # Should return LHD at N3
   mcp__memory__search_nodes("SR0024") # Should return Scaler at N3
   ```

### Future Improvements:

1. **Enhance vault sync** to automatically extract equipment from inventory documents
2. **Add equipment relations**: Link equipment to sites, projects, capital trackers
3. **Track equipment age**: Cross-reference with capital replacement plans
4. **Maintenance integration**: Link equipment to maintenance records (future)

## Testing the System

Once indexing is complete, you should be able to:

```bash
# Find any equipment by ID
"Where is DT0105?" → Gloria Mine, MT 436 LP dump truck
"Where is RT0039?" → N3 Mine, Boltec 235H roof bolter
"Where is UV0105?" → Gloria Mine, Seco UV100 water bowser ✅ WORKS NOW

# Find equipment by type
search_nodes("dump truck") → All DT#### units
search_nodes("water bowser") → UV0044, UV0105, UV0121

# Find equipment by site
search_nodes("N3 Mine") → All equipment at Nchwaning 3
search_nodes("Gloria") → All equipment at Gloria
```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **`.sync-pending.txt` must be committed** for memory sync to trigger
2. **Complex data structures** (tables, nested lists) need custom extraction logic
3. **Manual entity creation** is tedious but reliable for one-time bulk imports
4. **Batch processing** (10 entities at a time) prevents timeout issues
5. **Test early**: We should have tested equipment search immediately after creating the inventory file
