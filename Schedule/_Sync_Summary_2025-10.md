## SessionStart Hook Issue

**Problem:** The SessionStart hook configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` did not execute automatically when Claude Code started.

**Hook Configuration:**
```json
"SessionStart": [
  {
    "hooks": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/sync-outlook-calendar",
        "timeout": 60
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Hook execution timing - session startup might be too fast for hook to trigger
2. Silent hook failures without user notification
3. Timeout constraints (60 seconds might be insufficient if Outlook is slow)
4. Hook dependency on other processes completing first

**Resolution:**
- Manual trigger via `/sync-outlook-calendar` worked successfully
- All events synchronized properly
- Consider increasing timeout to 120 seconds or investigating Claude Code logs

**Recommendation:** Monitor future Claude Code session starts to determine if this is a consistent issue or one-time failure.
