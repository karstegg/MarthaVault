# Emergency Preparedness Meeting - Nov 10 2025

**Date:** November 10, 2025 (16:00-17:00)  
**Location:** Emergency Control Room  
**Host:** Jacques Farmer  
**Attendees:** Jacques Breet, Bret Marais, Corné Marais, Jacques Farmer, Michael Bester, Gregory Karsten

## Focus Areas
- Real-time monitoring systems for fire detection
- BEV-specific safety infrastructure (Li-Ion battery fire risks)
- Emergency refuge equipment maintenance
- SCADA integration for remote monitoring
- CO sensor requirements for lithium battery fires

## Critical Action Items

### 1. Real-Time Temperature Monitoring via Belt Scales
- **Action:** Identify which belts currently have temperature sensors
- **Due:** Nov 15, 2025
- **Priority:** High
- **Critical Note:** Sensors must not be applied to areas that don't require them

### 2. BEV Fire DDOPS CO Sensor Requirement (CRITICAL DECISION)
- **Decision:** BEV fire DDOPS must include CO (carbon monoxide) sensors
- **Rationale:** Lithium-ion battery fires produce different hazards than traditional mining fires
- **Due:** Nov 15, 2025
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Strategic Alignment:** Safety & Compliance Excellence (2.0x Q4 priority)

### 3. BEV Bay Firedoor Project Capex
- **Action:** Add temperature sensors to Capex budget for BEV bay firedoor project
- **Due:** Nov 15, 2025
- **Priority:** High
- **Project:** BEV Fire Safety Programme

### 4. Mine Arc Maintenance Training Program
- **Action:** Develop comprehensive training program for emergency refuge chambers
- **Requirements:**
  - Master plan
  - Job plans
  - OEM specifications
- **Due:** Nov 30, 2025
- **Priority:** Medium (safety-critical but longer timeframe)
- **Strategic Alignment:** Safety & Compliance Excellence

### 5. Surface Air Compressor SCADA Integration
- **Action:** Link surface air compressors to SCADA system via underground reticulation
- **Requirement:** Remote pressure monitoring capability
- **Assigned to:** Pieter (surname pending confirmation)
- **Due:** Nov 22, 2025
- **Priority:** High

## Safety Context
- BEV fire scenarios require CO monitoring (different from traditional mining fires)
- Temperature monitoring on conveyor belts enables early fire detection
- Emergency refuge chamber reliability is critical
- SCADA integration improves remote monitoring and emergency response

## Next Meeting
TBD (monthly cadence)
