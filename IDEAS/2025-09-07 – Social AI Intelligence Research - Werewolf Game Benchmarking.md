# Social AI Intelligence Research - Werewolf Game Benchmarking

## Source
**URL**: https://werewolf.foaster.ai/?s=09
**Discovery Date**: 2025-09-07
**Context**: AI research reference for GPT-5 discussion

## Research Overview
Fascinating research project exploring **social intelligence in Large Language Models** using the game of Werewolf as a sophisticated benchmark for evaluating AI social reasoning capabilities.

## Key Research Elements

### Methodology
- **Round-robin tournament** between 7 different LLMs
- Each model pair played 10 matches
- **Elo leaderboard** computed to rank performance
- Behavioral analysis as both wolves and villagers

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Persuasion skills** - ability to convince others
- **Coordination abilities** - working with teammates
- **Strategic thinking** - long-term social planning
- **Manipulation resistance** - avoiding deception as villagers
- **Manipulation capability** - effective deception as wolves
- **Long-context social dynamics** - maintaining consistent behavior
- **Adaptive reasoning** - responding to changing social situations

## Key Findings
- **"GPT-5 leads clearly"** in social intelligence rankings
- Move beyond traditional code/math benchmarks inadequate for social AI
- Complex language-driven games provide better social reasoning assessment
- Significant variation in models' social manipulation/resistance abilities

## Discussion Points for GPT-5
- How does social intelligence benchmarking compare to technical benchmarks?
- Implications for AI deployment in social/collaborative environments
- Potential applications in team dynamics and human-AI collaboration
- Ethical considerations of AI social manipulation capabilities

## Applications & Implications
- **AI assistant development** - better human interaction models
- **Collaborative AI systems** - improved team integration
- **Social simulation** - modeling human group dynamics
- **AI safety research** - understanding manipulation capabilities

## Research Questions
- How do social intelligence capabilities transfer to real-world applications?
- What are the ethical boundaries for AI social manipulation abilities?
- Could similar benchmarking apply to workplace collaboration scenarios?
- How might this influence AI development priorities?
