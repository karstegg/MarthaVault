# Self-Hosted Server Infrastructure Project

**Date**: September 2, 2025  
**Inspiration**: Twitter/X post about woman building her own server  
**Concept**: Replace cloud services with self-hosted alternatives  

## Project Vision
Set up personal network server to host:
- **Language Model**: Replace cloud-based AI services
- **Transcription Service**: Replace Google Cloud transcription
- **Personal Infrastructure**: Full control over data and services

## Motivation
- **Data Control**: Keep sensitive information on-premises
- **Cost Reduction**: Eliminate recurring cloud service fees
- **Learning Experience**: Advanced technical skill development
- **Privacy**: Complete data sovereignty
- **Customization**: Tailor services to specific needs

## Research Areas

### **Hardware Requirements**
- [ ] Server specifications for AI model hosting
- [ ] GPU requirements for language models
- [ ] Storage needs for transcription and AI models
- [ ] Network infrastructure requirements
- [ ] Power and cooling considerations

### **Software Stack**
- [ ] Operating system options (Linux distributions)
- [ ] Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes)
- [ ] AI model hosting platforms (Ollama, LocalAI)
- [ ] Transcription services (OpenAI Whisper self-hosted)
- [ ] Network security and VPN setup

### **AI Models to Host**
- [ ] Open-source language models (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
- [ ] Whisper for audio transcription
- [ ] Document processing models
- [ ] Custom fine-tuned models for mining/engineering context

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Research & Planning**
- [ ] Study the Twitter/X post for technical details
- [ ] Research hardware specifications and costs
- [ ] Evaluate open-source alternatives to current cloud services
- [ ] Plan network topology and security architecture

### **Phase 2: Hardware Setup**
- [ ] Procure server hardware
- [ ] Set up network infrastructure
- [ ] Configure basic server environment
- [ ] Implement security measures

### **Phase 3: Service Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy language model hosting
- [ ] Set up transcription service
- [ ] Configure remote access and API endpoints
- [ ] Test performance and reliability

### **Phase 4: Migration & Integration**
- [ ] Migrate existing workflows to self-hosted services
- [ ] Integrate with current automation systems
- [ ] Performance optimization and monitoring
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery setup

## Technical Considerations
- **Internet Bandwidth**: Upload/download requirements
- **Power Reliability**: UPS and backup power
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates and monitoring
- **Scaling**: Future expansion capabilities
- **Security**: Firewall, VPN, access controls

## Cost Analysis
- **Initial Hardware Investment**: Server, GPU, storage
- **Ongoing Costs**: Electricity, internet, maintenance
- **Cloud Service Savings**: Monthly/yearly subscription elimination
- **ROI Timeline**: Break-even analysis

- Current Google Cloud transcription usage
- Production report automation systems

## Next Steps
- [ ] Find and analyze the Twitter/X post that inspired this
- [ ] Research hardware recommendations from r/homelab or similar communities
- [ ] Evaluate current cloud service costs for comparison
- [ ] Create detailed technical specification document
- [ ] Consider pilot project with single service (e.g., transcription)
