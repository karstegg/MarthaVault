# AI Integration Reference Note

**Date**: 2025-08-16
**Context**: Safe testing setup for FREE Gemini AI processing alternative

## Overview

Successfully implemented safe testing approach for AI integration as a cost-effective alternative to premium processing ($0.39/day savings).

## Files Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/ai-pdr-processing.yml`
- Complete AI CLI integration
- Uses cost-effective model processing
- Isolated workflow with same data extraction logic as Claude version
- Triggered by repository dispatch event: `pdr-ai`

### 2. Command Script
**File**: `.claude/commands/pdr-ai`
- Triggers AI processing workflow
- Same interface as `/pdr-cloud` but routes to AI processing
- Usage: `/pdr-ai 2025-07-12`

### 3. Configuration File
**File**: `AI_CONFIG.md` (Version 3.0)
- **REPLACED**: Original AI Constitution with PDR-specific configuration
- **BACKUP**: Original saved as `AI_CONFIG.md.backup-20250816-122610`
- Contains comprehensive JSON schema, Markdown templates, equipment codes
- Tailored specifically for daily production report processing

## Backup Information

**Original AI_CONFIG.md**: `AI_CONFIG.md.backup-20250816-122610`
- Contains original AI Constitution (Version 2.0)
- Role selection protocol, workflow guidelines, triage procedures
- Can be restored if needed: `cp AI_CONFIG.md.backup-20250816-122610 AI_CONFIG.md`

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Test Integration**: `/pdr-ai 2025-07-12` with July 12th historical data
2. **Compare Results**: AI vs Claude processing quality, cost, speed
3. **Quality Assessment**: Verify data accuracy and report formatting
4. **Performance Analysis**: Measure processing time and token usage

## Branch Structure

- **Master**: Now contains AI integration files for testing
- **experiment/ai-cli**: Development branch (unchanged)
- **Source Files**: Successfully copied from experiment branch to master

## Authentication

- **AI API Key**: Configured in repository secrets (`AI_API_KEY`)
- **Repository Dispatch**: Only works on master branch (limitation resolved)
- **Rate Limits**: Free tier (should be sufficient for testing)

## Cost Comparison

- **Claude Cloud**: $0.39/day (35,000 tokens typical weekday)
- **AI Processing**: FREE (Free tier)
- **Potential Savings**: 100% cost reduction for daily processing

## Technical Integration

Successfully resolved GitHub repository dispatch limitation by implementing Option 1 approach:
- Safely copied integration files to master branch
- Preserved original configuration with timestamped backup
- Maintained isolation between Claude and AI workflows
