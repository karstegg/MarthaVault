# Integrate Load & Haul Production Reports

**Date Added**: 2025-08-11  
**Source**: Stephen Klopper (Mine Overseer, Load & Haul Section N3)  
**Description**: Integrate shift-level Load & Haul production reports into daily production reporting system

## Current State
- MO (Mine Overseer) [[Stephen Klopper]] provides end-of-shift Load & Haul reports
- Reports cover detailed face-by-face loading data, equipment performance, and breakdowns
- Different from engineer-level daily production reports (more operational detail)
- Reports include: faces loaded/cleaned, load counts per face, equipment utilization, breakdown details

## Integration Concept
- Add Load & Haul data as supplementary section in daily production reports
- Combine MO shift data with engineering daily summaries
- Enhance equipment breakdown tracking with shift-level detail
- Provide more granular operational insights

## Benefits
- Complete operational picture (engineering + mining department perspectives)
- Enhanced equipment performance tracking
- Better breakdown analysis with shift-level data
- Improved production planning insights

## Implementation Notes
- Would require messaging integration for Mining Production group messages
- Need to distinguish between engineer reports and MO shift reports
- Consider timing differences (shift vs daily reporting cycles)
- Maintain data source separation for clarity

## Sample Data Structure
From 31Jul25 Dayshift report:
```
Safety: Clear
Total faces Loaded: 8
Faces Cleaned: Central (4 faces), North west (4 faces)
Total Loads: 107 (Target: 90)
Equipment: LHD=5, DT=10
Breakdowns: DT 149 (oil leak), DT 148 (powerless), DT 161 (over speedy), FL 91 (b/down), FL 101 (b/down), FL 112 (module connect)
```
