# MarthaVault Repository Split Implementation Plan

**Date**: August 24, 2025  
**Type**: Implementation Plan  
**Project**: Repository Architecture Optimization  
**Scope**: Split MarthaVault into specialized repositories

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to split the current MarthaVault repository into two specialized repositories: **ProductionReports** (automated production data processing) and **MarthaVault** (work task management). This separation will create clear boundaries, improve system reliability, and establish single points of control for different operational functions.

## Background & Current State

### Current MarthaVault Architecture
MarthaVault currently serves as a unified Obsidian knowledge management system containing:

**Production Data Processing:**
- Automated production data processing capabilities
- External integrations for data extraction
- Processing workflows and automation
- Real-time data access capabilities
- Complex automation pipelines with strict data validation

**Work Task Management:**
- Personal and work task tracking
- Project management for mining operations
- Personnel directory and organizational context
- Ideas management and strategic planning
- Traditional knowledge management workflows

### Technical Infrastructure
- **AI Agent Architecture**: External processing + coordination + review
- **Data Pipeline**: Source → JSON/Markdown → Repository → Review → Merge
- **Cost**: Optimized using cost-effective processing solutions
- **Integration**: 24/7 data bridge, remote access, automated workflows

## Business Case for Split

### 1. **Operational Separation**
- **Production data** requires 24/7 reliability for mining operations
- **Task management** operates on different schedules and priorities
- Mixed responsibilities create unnecessary complexity and risk

### 2. **Risk Management**
- Personal vault changes shouldn't affect critical production workflows
- Production automation needs isolated, controlled environment
- Single point of failure currently exists in unified repository

### 3. **Access Control & Security**
- Production data may require different access permissions
- Task management contains personal/strategic information
- Separation enables granular security controls

### 4. **Performance & Scalability**
- Production processing optimized for data throughput
- Task management optimized for knowledge management
- Each system can scale independently

### 5. **Maintenance & Development**
- Production workflows require enterprise-grade stability
- Task management allows for experimental features
- Reduces testing complexity and deployment risk

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Creation & Duplication

#### Step 1.1: Create ProductionReports Repository
```bash
# Duplicate entire MarthaVault repository
git clone https://github.com/karstegg/MarthaVault.git ProductionReports
cd ProductionReports
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/karstegg/ProductionReports.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 1.2: Verify Infrastructure Transfer
- Confirm all automated workflows are present
- Verify development configurations are intact
- Test data integration functionality
- Validate all secrets and environment variables

### Phase 2: ProductionReports Specialization

#### Step 2.1: Remove Task Management Content
**Folders to DELETE from ProductionReports:**
- `tasks/` - Task management files
- `projects/` - Project folders  
- `personal/` - Personal content
- `IDEAS/` - Idea management
- `Schedule/` - Scheduling content
- `Archive/` - Archived task content
- `Adjudication_Committee_Meetings/` - Meeting records
- `Standby lists/` - Operational scheduling
- `Templates/` - Task templates
- `commit_messages/` - Development artifacts
- `testing/` - Development testing files

#### Step 2.2: Retain Production Infrastructure
**Keep in ProductionReports:**
- `.github/workflows/` - All automated workflows
- `messaging-server/` - Data integration server
- `daily_production/` - Production data and processing
- `reference/equipment/` - Fleet database, equipment codes
- `reference/locations/` - Mine sites, operational areas
- `people/` - Engineer assignments (minimal copy for processing context)
- `.devcontainer/` - Development container configurations
- `scripts/` - Production processing scripts
- All development configurations and secrets

#### Step 2.3: Update ProductionReports CLAUDE.md
Create specialized configuration focusing on:
- Production data processing workflows
- Data validation requirements (critical for reliability)
- Equipment code validation and BEV classification
- Engineer-site mapping and report processing
- Automation workflow instructions
- Data integration guidelines

### Phase 3: MarthaVault Simplification

#### Step 3.1: Remove Production Automation
**DELETE from MarthaVault:**
- `.github/workflows/` - **Entire folder** (all automation workflows)
- `messaging-server/` - Data integration server
- `daily_production/` - Production data
- `.devcontainer/` - Development containers
- Production-related scripts and configurations

#### Step 3.2: Retain Task Management
**Keep in MarthaVault:**
- `tasks/` - Task management system
- `projects/` - Project management
- `people/` - Personnel management
- `personal/` - Personal content
- `IDEAS/` - Idea management
- `reference/` - Reference materials
- `Schedule/` - Scheduling and meetings
- `Archive/` - Historical content
- Basic Git functionality for backup/versioning

#### Step 3.3: Update MarthaVault CLAUDE.md
Simplify configuration to focus on:
- Task management workflows
- Project organization
- Personnel tracking
- Idea management
- Traditional Obsidian knowledge management
- Remove all production automation references

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Migration

#### Step 4.1: Codespace Reassignment
- Update development connection to point to ProductionReports repository
- Transfer all production-related secrets and configurations
- Test data integration bridge connectivity from new repository

#### Step 4.2: Automation Configuration
- Verify all production workflows function in ProductionReports
- Update repository references in workflow files
- Test end-to-end automation pipeline

#### Step 4.3: Cross-Repository Linking
- Configure MarthaVault to link to ProductionReports for report viewing
- Maintain minimal people/ data in ProductionReports for processing context
- Establish clear boundaries for data access

### Phase 5: Validation & Testing

#### Step 5.1: Production Workflow Testing
- Test complete production report processing pipeline
- Verify data validation and source verification requirements
- Confirm automation workflows function correctly

#### Step 5.2: Task Management Testing
- Verify MarthaVault functions as traditional knowledge management system
- Test task tracking and project management workflows
- Confirm no production automation remains

#### Step 5.3: Integration Testing
- Test cross-repository linking functionality
- Verify data boundaries are maintained
- Confirm single point of control for production data
