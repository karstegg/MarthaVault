| **Decline** | 3,781t | 7,498t | -3,717t | **50.4% (49.6% below target)** 🔴 |
| **Product** | 3,294t | 6,618t | -3,324t | **49.8% (50.2% below target)** 🔴 |

**Additional Production Data:**
- **Waste**: 1,077t from decline operations

#### Load & Haul Fleet Performance (Truckloads Tipped by Shift)
| Shift | Loads | Target | Performance |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Day | 53 | - | **53 loads** ⚠️ |
| Afternoon | 68 | - | **68 loads** ⚠️ |
| Night | 64 | - | **64 loads** ⚠️ |
| **Total** | **185** | **-** | **185 loads** |

Load performance appears reasonable but production tonnage severely impacted.

#### Blast Performance

### Equipment Status

#### TMM Availability
| Equipment | Availability | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **DT** | **80%** | 🔴 Poor performance - critical equipment issues |
| **FL** | **83%** | 🔴 Poor performance - significant issues |
| **HD** | **92%** | ✅ Good performance |
| **RT** | **97%** | ✅ Excellent performance |
| **SR** | **66%** | 🔴 Critical - severely impacted operations |

**Poor Performance Analysis:**
- **SR**: At 66% availability - critical equipment failure affecting scaling operations
- **DT**: At 80% availability - significant truck fleet issues impacting hauling
- **FL**: At 83% availability - loader fleet problems affecting material movement

#### Equipment Readiness (Start of Shift)
- **DT**: 11/14 available (79%) 🔴
- **FL**: 9/10 available (90%) ⚠️
- **HD**: 7/9 available (78%) 🔴
- **RT**: 9/10 available (90%) ✅
- **SR**: 7/10 available (70%) 🔴
- **UV**: 8/9 available (89%) ⚠️

### Current Breakdowns (9 Units)

#### Dump Truck Equipment Issues
- **DT0145**: Gears & Aircon system failure

#### Hydraulic Drill Equipment Issues
- **HD0052**: Water box seals replacement needed

#### Scaler Equipment Issues
- **SR0024**: Boom cracked - structural damage
- **SR0026**: Brake system failure
- **SR0030**: Incident repairs ongoing

#### Utility Vehicle Equipment Issues
- **UV0045**: Engine not starting
- **UV0044**: Propshaft failure (0% availability)
- **UV0124**: Complete power loss

#### Heavy Equipment Issues
- **DZ0011**: Transmission oil pressure problems (0% availability)

### Support Equipment Summary
- **Emulsion UV**: 100% ✅ (4/4 available)
- **Manlifts**: 100% ✅ (4/4 available)
- **Specialized Equipment**: GD11 100% ✅, DZ11 0% 🔴, UV044 0% 🔴

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Fans**: Operational ✅
- **Plant Blockages**: None 🟢
- **Fire Alarms**: None 🟢

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear status - no incidents ✅
- **Production**: Critical failure - all metrics 28-50% below target 🔴
- **Equipment**: Severe equipment availability issues across multiple categories 🔴
- **Operations**: Infrastructure stable but production severely compromised 🔴

## Supplemental Information

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention
1. **🚨 CRITICAL**: Production performance 28-50% below targets - immediate intervention required
2. **🚨 CRITICAL**: SR availability at 66% - scaling operations severely compromised
3. **🔴 URGENT**: 9 units with active breakdowns requiring immediate attention
4. **🔴 URGENT**: DT availability at 80% - hauling capacity significantly reduced
5. **🔴 HIGH**: DZ11 and UV044 completely out of service

### Equipment Crisis Analysis
**Major Equipment Failures:**
- **Structural Damage**: SR0024 boom crack requires immediate safety assessment
- **Power Systems**: UV0124 complete power loss, UV0045 engine failure
- **Transmission Issues**: DZ0011 transmission oil pressure - expensive repair
- **Multiple SR Units**: 3 scalers down (SR0024, SR0026, SR0030) - 30% of fleet

### BEV Equipment Performance Note
Nchwaning 3 has the full BEV fleet (7 BEV dump trucks, 6 BEV front loaders). Equipment availability issues may be affecting BEV performance metrics.

### Production Impact Assessment
The severe production shortfall (28-50% below target) combined with multiple equipment failures suggests:
- Potential maintenance scheduling problems
- Resource allocation issues
- Possible operational strategy review needed

### Immediate Action Items
1. **Emergency maintenance review** for SR fleet (66% availability)
2. **DT fleet assessment** to address 20% availability loss
3. **Incident investigation** for SR0030 ongoing repairs
4. **Safety inspection** for SR0024 boom crack
5. **Production strategy adjustment** to compensate for equipment limitations
