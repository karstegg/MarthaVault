**Date**: August 12, 2025 (Data from August 11, 2025)  
**Engineer**: [[Johan Kotze]] (Acting for [[Sikilela Nzuza]] on leave)  
**Site**: Nchwaning 2 Mine

## üö® CRITICAL UNDERPERFORMANCE - Operational Constraints

### Safety Status
Clear - No incidents reported

### Production Performance
| Metric | Actual | Target | Variance | % of Target |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ROM (tons)** | 4,779 | 6,903 | -2,124 | 69.2% |
| **Product (tons)** | 2,702 | 6,514 | -3,812 | **41.5%** |

**Critical Issue**: Orepass full from weekend with Seam1 material - Day shift couldn't run plant until ore pass cleared

| Shift | Truckloads Tipped |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Day** | 13 |
| **Afternoon** | 50 |
| **Night** | 58 |
| **Total** | **121** |

**Day Shift Impact**: Severely limited due to orepass blockage

#### Blast Performance
Planned: 16 faces | Actual: Not specified

| **Fire Alarms** | 0 |

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear status with no incidents - good safety performance
- **Production**: **CRITICAL** underperformance with Product at only 41.5% of target due to orepass blockage from weekend Seam1 material
- **Equipment**: Mixed performance - excellent TMM availability but critical UV support constraints
- **Operations**: Day shift severely impacted by operational constraints, afternoon/night shifts performing well

## Supplemental Information

### Operational Constraints Analysis
- **Primary Issue**: Orepass blockage from weekend Seam1 operations prevented day shift plant operations
- **Day Shift Impact**: Only 13 loads vs typical 50+ loads due to plant unavailability
- **Recovery Pattern**: Afternoon (50 loads) and night (58 loads) shifts performing normally after orepass clearing

### Critical Support Equipment Issues
- **Logistics UVs**: Only 33% availability severely limiting material support
- **Sampling Operations**: Completely shut down (0% availability) affecting quality control
- **Grader**: GD12 completely down affecting road maintenance

### Equipment Performance Highlights
- Strong TMM availability across most categories (91-97%)
- Excellent dozer availability supporting operations
- Survey operations maintained at high availability (97%)

### Key Action Items
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Ensure orepass management procedures prevent future weekend blockages
2. **URGENT**: Restore logistics UV fleet to support operational requirements  
3. **HIGH**: Repair sampling manlifts to restore quality control capabilities
4. **MEDIUM**: Address grader availability for road maintenance support
