2. **📊 FOLLOW-UP**: Analyze the significant production shortfall on Saturday and Sunday to understand root causes and implement corrective actions for future weekend operations.

## Supplemental Information

### Department Responsibilities
**Shafts & Winders** manages critical infrastructure across all three mine sites:
- **Manwinders**: Personnel transport systems (Nch2 PW, Nch3 PW, GL PW)
- **Rock Winder**: Nchwaning 2 ore hoisting from underground to surface silos (Nch2 RW)
- **Main Fans**: Ventilation systems essential for underground safety
- **Support Infrastructure**: Power supply, lamprooms, and related systems

### Daily Details
- **Power Systems**: All power systems are stable with no reported interruptions.
- **Winding Systems**: All manwinders and the Nchwaning 2 rock winder are fully operational.
- **Ventilation**: Main fans across all sites are functioning correctly, ensuring adequate underground ventilation.
- **Safety Systems**: Lamprooms are operational, and there are no active fire SCADA alarms.
- **Water Management**: DD01 is at full capacity, while DD02 is at a stable but lower level. Ore pass levels show a declining trend, requiring attention.

### Analysis/Trends Section
The infrastructure managed by Shafts & Winders remains highly reliable, with all critical systems operational. However, the declining trend in ore pass levels and the significant production shortfalls observed on Saturday and Sunday require immediate attention to ensure smooth material flow and consistent production targets are met.
