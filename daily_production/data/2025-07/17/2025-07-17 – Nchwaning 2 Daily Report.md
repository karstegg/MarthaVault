**Engineer**: [[Sikelela Nzuza]]  
**Site**: Nchwaning 2  

## ⚠️ ATTENTION REQUIRED - Production and Equipment Issues

### Safety Status
✅ **CLEAR** - No incidents reported

### Production Performance
⚠️ **BELOW TARGET** - ROM and Product data were not reported, and only 10 loads were tipped on the day shift.

| Metric | Actual | Target | Variance | Performance |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ROM** | N/At | 6,903t | N/At | **N/A (N/A of target)** ⚠️ |
| **Decline** | N/At | N/At | N/At | **N/A (N/A of target)** ⚠️ |
| **Product** | N/At | 6,514t | N/At | **N/A (N/A of target)** ⚠️ |

#### Load & Haul Fleet Performance (Truckloads Tipped by Shift)
| Shift | Loads | Target | Performance |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Day | 10 | - | **Significantly below expected** 🔴 |
| Afternoon | N/A | - | **No report** ⚠️ |
| Night | N/A | - | **No report** ⚠️ |
| **Total** | **10** | **-** | **Very low overall performance** |

Additional load performance details: Pulled Graben (seam 1) so 2West staged yesterday.

#### Blast Performance
- **Target**: 16 faces, actual not reported ⚠️

### Equipment Status

#### TMM Availability
| Equipment | Availability | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **DT** | **87%** | ⚠️ Below optimal, requires attention |
| **FL** | **80%** | ⚠️ Below optimal, requires attention |
| **HD** | **92%** | 🟢 Good availability |
| **RT** | **96%** | 🟢 Excellent availability |
| **SR** | **80%** | ⚠️ Below optimal, requires attention |

**Poor Performance Analysis:**
- **Dump Truck (DT)**: Availability at 87% is below optimal, potentially impacting material transport.
- **Front-end Loader (FL)**: Availability at 80% is below optimal, affecting loading operations.
- **Scraper (SR)**: Availability at 80% is below optimal, indicating issues with scraping operations.

#### Equipment Readiness (Start of Shift)
- **DT**: 8/9 available (88.9%) ⚠️
- **FL**: 5/6 available (83.3%) ⚠️
- **HD**: 6/6 available (100%) 🟢
- **RT**: 6/6 available (100%) 🟢
- **SR**: 5/6 available (83.3%) ⚠️

### Current Breakdowns (13 Units)

#### Dump Truck Equipment Issues
- **DT120**: door controller

#### Front-end Loader Equipment Issues
- **FL102**: aircon
- **FL85**: propshaft

#### Scraper Equipment Issues
- **SR25**: wheel frame
- **SR46**: hyd pump crack

#### Utility Vehicle Equipment Issues
- **UV90**: water pump & timing
- **UV37**: steering
- **UV59**: engine
- **UV54**: oil leak
- **UV102**: low revs
- **UV77**: service
- **UV92**: diesel leak
- **UV133**: brakes

### Support Equipment Summary
- **Dozer (DZ13)**: 100% 🟢 Fully available
- **Grader (GD12)**: 100% 🟢 Fully available
- **Emulsion UV**: 100% 🟢 Fully available
- **Logistics UV**: 61% 🔴 Critical, significant issues
- **Sampling UV**: 67% 🔴 Critical, significant issues
- **Survey UV**: 100% 🟢 Fully available

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Fans**: Nothing Reported ⚠️
- **Plant Blockages**: None 🟢
- **Fire Alarms**: None 🟢

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear 🟢
- **Production**: Significant shortfalls with unreported ROM/Product and very low loads tipped. 🔴
- **Equipment**: Multiple breakdowns across TMM and UV fleets, leading to below optimal availability for several key equipment types. 🔴
- **Operations**: Plant blockages and fire alarms are clear, but overall operations are heavily impacted by production and equipment issues. 🔴

## Supplemental Information

### Critical Issues Section
1. **🔴 URGENT**: Multiple equipment breakdowns, particularly affecting Logistics and Sampling UVs, and several TMM units. This is severely impacting operational efficiency and production.
2. **🔴 HIGH**: Unreported ROM and Product data, along with very low loads tipped, indicates a significant gap in production reporting and actual output. Immediate investigation and corrective actions are required.
