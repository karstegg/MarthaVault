4. **📊 FOLLOW-UP**: Monitor DD02 dam levels, which are at 79.5%.

## Supplemental Information

### Department Responsibilities
**Shafts & Winders** manages critical infrastructure across all three mine sites:
- **Manwinders**: Personnel transport systems (Nch2 PW, Nch3 PW, GL PW)
- **Rock Winder**: Nchwaning 2 ore hoisting from underground to surface silos (Nch2 RW)
- **Main Fans**: Ventilation systems essential for underground safety
- **Support Infrastructure**: Power supply, lamprooms, and related systems

### Daily Details
- **Power Systems**: Stable with no reported stoppages.
- **Winding Systems**: Manwinders are fully operational. Nch2 Rock Winder is undergoing a barrel repair project, impacting ore hoisting.
- **Ventilation**: Main fans across all sites are operational.
- **Safety Systems**: No safety incidents reported. 4 non-emergency comms alarms were noted.
- **Water Management**: DD01 dam levels are stable and good. DD02 levels are at 79.5%, requiring attention. Ore pass levels showed a slight improvement from Friday to Saturday.

### Analysis/Trends Section
Saturday's production was severely impacted, likely due to the Nch2 Rock Winder repair project. This highlights the critical dependency on this infrastructure for ore hoisting. The non-emergency comms alarms should be investigated to prevent potential future issues. DD02 dam levels are approaching the warning threshold and require monitoring.
