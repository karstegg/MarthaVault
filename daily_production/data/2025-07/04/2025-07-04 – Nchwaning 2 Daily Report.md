## Equipment Status & Availability

### TMM Production Fleet Performance

| Equipment | Availability | Fleet Status | Operational | Issues |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **DT** | 92% | 🟢 Excellent | 9/9 | None |
| **FL** | 76% | 🟡 Below Target | 6/6 | FL85 propshaft, FL92 park brake |
| **HD** | 98% | 🟢 Excellent | 6/6 | HD63 percussion hose |
| **RT** | 74% | 🟡 Below Target | 5/6 | RT43 oil leak |
| **SR** | 98% | 🟢 Excellent | 6/6 | None |

### Support Equipment
- **DZ13 (Dozer):** 100% ✅
- **GD12 (Grader):** 100% ✅

### Utility Vehicle Fleet

| Category | Units | Availability | Status |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Emulsion** | UV62, UV66, UV108 | 100% | 🟢 Excellent |
| **Logistics** | UV54, UV59, UV120 | 66% | 🟡 Below Target |
| **Sampling** | UV77, UV123 | 100% | 🟢 Excellent |
| **Survey** | UV98, UV99 | 50% | 🔴 Poor |

## Active Equipment Breakdowns

### Critical Issues
1. **UV90** - Water pump & timing failure
2. **FL85** - Propshaft damage
3. **UV54** - Oil leak (logistics impact)
4. **UV98** - Bucket damage (survey impact)

### Maintenance Required
5. **FL92** - Park brake system
6. **HD63** - Percussion hose replacement
7. **RT43** - Oil leak repair

## Performance Analysis

### Critical Success Factors
- ✅ Safety maintained (Clear status)
- ✅ DT fleet at 92% availability
- ✅ HD and SR fleets performing excellently
- ✅ Zero plant blockages

### Major Concerns
- 🔴 **Plant Reliability Crisis** - 5.37-hour breakdown
- 🔴 **Product Recovery Failure** - Only 28.6% of target achieved
- 🔴 **Multiple Equipment Categories Affected** - FL, RT, UV fleets
- 🔴 **Logistics Support Compromised** - UV fleet at 66%

### Recovery Priorities
1. **Immediate:** Plant breakdown root cause analysis
2. **High:** FL fleet maintenance (propshaft, brake systems)
3. **High:** RT fleet oil leak repairs  
4. **Medium:** UV logistics fleet restoration
5. **Medium:** Survey vehicle bucket repair program

## Trend Analysis
This represents a significant deterioration from typical Nchwaning 2 performance, with the plant breakdown being the primary driver of production shortfall. The combination of infrastructure failure and multiple equipment breakdowns suggests systematic maintenance challenges requiring immediate management attention.

## Recommendations
1. **Emergency plant reliability assessment** and preventive maintenance review
2. **Accelerated FL and RT fleet repair program** 
3. **UV fleet logistics support restoration** to maintain operations continuity
4. **Enhanced monitoring** of multiple breakdown categories
5. **Production recovery planning** for following shifts
