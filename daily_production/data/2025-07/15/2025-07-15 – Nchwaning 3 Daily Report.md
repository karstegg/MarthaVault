### Equipment Status

#### TMM Availability
| Equipment | Availability | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **DT** | **80%** | ⚠️ **Below optimal, requires attention** |
| **FL** | **82%** | ⚠️ **Below optimal, requires attention** |
| **HD** | **91%** | 🟢 **Good availability** |
| **RT** | **91%** | 🟢 **Good availability** |
| **SR** | **84%** | ⚠️ **Below optimal, requires attention** |

**Poor Performance Analysis:**
- **DT**: Availability at 80% indicates multiple units out of service.
- **FL**: Availability at 82% indicates some units out of service.
- **SR**: Availability at 84% indicates some units out of service.

#### Equipment Readiness (Start of Shift)
- **HD**: 8/9 available (89%) ⚠️
- **DT**: 10/14 available (71%) ⚠️
- **FL**: 7/10 available (70%) ⚠️
- **RT**: 10/10 available (100%) 🟢
- **SR**: 6/10 available (60%) 🔴
- **UV**: 9/9 available (100%) 🟢

### Current Breakdowns (8 Units)

#### Dump Truck Equipment Issues
- **DT0147**: Awaiting electrical communication cable
- **DT0146**: Charging
- **DT0150**: Gears
- **DT0161**: Gears

#### Front-end Loader Equipment Issues
- **FL0107**: Half arrows repair

#### Hydraulic Drill Equipment Issues
- **HD0062**: Front centre LHB

#### Scraper Equipment Issues
- **SR0030**: Tag system faulty

#### Utility Vehicle Equipment Issues

- **Dozer (DZ11)**: 100% 🟢 Operational
- **UV044**: 78% ⚠️ Below optimal
- **Manlifts**: 100% 🟢 Operational
- **Emulsion UV**: 100% 🟢 Operational

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Fans**: No report
- **Plant Blockages**: 1 reported (60CV01) 🔴
- **Fire Alarms**: None 🟢

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear 🟢
- **Production**: Critical ROM shortfall, Decline below target, but Product exceeded target. 🔴
- **Equipment**: Multiple TMMs (DT, FL, SR) and UV044 are below optimal availability. SR readiness is critical. 🔴
- **Operations**: One plant blockage reported. Main fans status not reported. ⚠️

## Supplemental Information

### Critical Issues Section
1. **🔴 URGENT**: **ROM Production Shortfall**: ROM is 54.9% below target, indicating a severe impact on overall production. Immediate investigation and corrective actions are required.
2. **🔴 URGENT**: **Scraper (SR) Readiness**: Only 60% of Scrapers are ready for shift, significantly impacting cleaning and scraping operations.
3. **🔴 URGENT**: **Plant Blockage**: One plant blockage reported (60CV01), requiring immediate attention to clear and restore flow.
4. **⚠️ MEDIUM**: **Dump Truck (DT) Availability and Readiness**: Both availability (80%) and readiness (71%) are below optimal, with multiple units experiencing breakdowns (electrical, charging, gears).
5. **⚠️ MEDIUM**: **Front-end Loader (FL) Availability and Readiness**: Both availability (82%) and readiness (70%) are below optimal, with one unit requiring half arrows repair.
