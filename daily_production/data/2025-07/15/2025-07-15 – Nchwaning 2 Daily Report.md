**Date**: July 15, 2025 (Data from July 14, 2025)  
**Engineer**: [[Sikelela Nzuza]]  
**Site**: Nchwaning 2  

## ⚠️ Production and Equipment Availability Concerns

### Safety Status
✅ **CLEAR** - No incidents reported

### Production Performance
⚠️ **ROM performance is good, but Product is below optimal. Blast data is incomplete.**

| Metric | Actual | Target | Variance | Performance |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ROM** | 6,390t | 6,903t | -513t | **92.6% (7.4% below target)** 🟢 |
| **Decline** | Nothing Reported | Nothing Reported | Nothing Reported | **Nothing Reported** |
| **Product** | 4,677t | 6,514t | -1,837t | **71.8% (28.2% below target)** ⚠️ |

#### Load & Haul Fleet Performance (Truckloads Tipped by Shift)
| Shift | Loads | Target | Performance |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Day | 67 | - | **Good performance** 🟢 |
| Afternoon | 83 | - | **Strong performance** 🟢 |
| Night | 58 | - | **Good performance** 🟢 |
| **Total** | **208** | **-** | **Consistent load tipping across shifts** |

#### Blast Performance
- **Target**: 16 faces. Actual not reported.

### Equipment Status

#### TMM Availability
| Equipment | Availability | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **DT** | **84%** | ⚠️ **Below optimal, requires attention** |
| **FL** | **74%** | ⚠️ **Below optimal, requires attention** |
| **HD** | **95%** | 🟢 **Good availability** |
| **RT** | **95%** | 🟢 **Good availability** |
| **SR** | **99%** | 🟢 **Excellent availability** |

**Poor Performance Analysis:**
- **DT**: Availability at 84% indicates some units were out of service.
- **FL**: Availability at 74% indicates some units were out of service, impacting loading capacity.

#### Equipment Readiness (Start of Shift)
- **DT**: 8/9 available (89%) ⚠️ (DT120 door controller issue)
- **FL**: 5/6 available (83%) ⚠️ (FL86 bucket pin issue)
- **HD**: 6/6 available (100%) 🟢
- **RT**: 6/6 available (100%) 🟢
- **SR**: 6/6 available (100%) 🟢

### Current Breakdowns (7 Units)

#### Utility Vehicle Equipment Issues
- **UV90**: Water pump & timing
- **UV37**: Gears
- **UV59**: Engine
- **UV54**: Oil leak
- **UV133**: Brakes

#### Front-end Loader Equipment Issues
- **FL85**: Propshaft

#### Scraper Equipment Issues
- **SR46**: Oil leak

### Support Equipment Summary
- **Dozer (DZ13)**: 100% 🟢 Operational
- **Grader (GD12)**: 100% 🟢 Operational
- **Emulsion UVs**: 100% 🟢 Operational
- **Logistics UV**: 33% 🔴 Critical availability due to multiple breakdowns.
- **Sampling UV**: 100% 🟢 Operational
- **Survey UV**: 100% 🟢 Operational

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Fans**: No report
- **Plant Blockages**: 0 🟢
- **Fire Alarms**: No report

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear 🟢
- **Production**: ROM is good, but Product is significantly below target. Blast data is incomplete. ⚠️
- **Equipment**: TMM availability for DT and FL is below optimal. Logistics UV availability is critical due to multiple breakdowns. 🔴
- **Operations**: Plant blockages are clear. Main fans and fire alarm status not reported. ⚠️

## Supplemental Information

### Critical Issues Section
1. **🔴 URGENT**: **Logistics UV Availability**: Only 33% available due to multiple breakdowns (UV59 engine, UV54 oil leak, UV133 brakes). This severely impacts logistics support.
2. **⚠️ MEDIUM**: **Product Production Shortfall**: Product is 28.2% below target, requiring immediate attention to identify and address root causes.
3. **⚠️ MEDIUM**: **DT and FL Availability**: Both Dump Trucks and Front-end Loaders are operating below optimal availability, impacting overall production efficiency.
