#### Dam Levels (Daily Tracking)
| Dam | Day/Period | Status |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| **DD01** | **100.4%** | [🟢] Stable and at optimal levels. |
| **DD02** | **86.7%** | [⚠️] Below optimal levels, requires monitoring. |

#### Ore Pass Levels
- **Thursday**: 14.2%
- **Tracking Period**: Critically low and declining trend, indicating potential material flow issues.

### Production Daily Performance

#### Daily Production Summary
| Day | Actual | Target | Variance | Performance | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Friday** | **7,207t** | **6,621t** | **+586t** | **108.8%** | [🟢] Above target |
| **Saturday** | **259t** | **1,577t** | **-1,318t** | **16.4%** | [🔴] Significantly below target |

### Operational Status
- **Fire SCADA Alarms**: 0 [🟢]
- **Block Chutes**: None [🟢]

## Actions Required

1. **⚠️ MEDIUM**: Monitor Dam DD02 levels closely and investigate reasons for below-optimal levels.
2. **🔴 URGENT**: Investigate critically low and declining ore pass levels to prevent potential operational bottlenecks.
3. **📊 FOLLOW-UP**: Review weekend production shortfalls to identify contributing factors and implement corrective actions.

## Supplemental Information

### Department Responsibilities
**Shafts & Winders** manages critical infrastructure across all three mine sites:
- **Manwinders**: Personnel transport systems (Nch2 PW, Nch3 PW, GL PW)
- **Rock Winder**: Nchwaning 2 ore hoisting from underground to surface silos (Nch2 RW)
- **Main Fans**: Ventilation systems essential for underground safety
- **Support Infrastructure**: Power supply, lamprooms, and related systems

### Daily Infrastructure Overview
- **Power Systems**: Operational [🟢]
- **Winding Systems**: Generally operational, with a resolved issue at Nch3 PW [🟢]
- **Ventilation**: Operational [🟢]
- **Safety Systems**: Clear [🟢]
- **Water Management**: DD01 stable, DD02 requires attention [⚠️]

### Analysis/Trends Section
The Nch3 PW issue was promptly resolved by the Winder Technician Electrician Team, demonstrating effective response to minor infrastructure delays. However, the critically low ore pass levels and the below-target production on Saturday and Sunday require immediate attention to ensure continuous material flow and meet production targets.
