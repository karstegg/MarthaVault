- **Equipment Codes**: Mix of TMM and specialized equipment

### Site Identification Required
**Engineer Assignment Needed**: 
- Cross-reference sender ID 219064991522977 with known engineers
- Verify equipment codes against site-specific databases
- Compare production patterns with historical site data
- Confirm site assignment before processing

### Next Actions Required
1. **Manual Site Identification**: Greg to identify correct site based on sender and equipment patterns
2. **Engineer Mapping**: Verify which engineer sent this report
3. **Reprocess**: Once identified, reprocess using appropriate site template
4. **Update Sender Database**: Add sender ID to engineer mapping for future automation

### Data Quality Notes
- Complete safety and operational data available
- Equipment availability percentages provided
- Breakdown details documented
- Infrastructure status reported

**Priority**: Medium - Report contains operational data but requires proper site assignment for accurate filing and analysis.
