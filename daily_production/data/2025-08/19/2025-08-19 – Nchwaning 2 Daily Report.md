🔴 **2 FIRE ALARMS** - Requires investigation

### Production Performance
🔴 **SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT SHORTFALL**

| Metric | Actual | Target | Variance | Performance |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ROM** | 6,477t | 6,903t | -426t | **93.8% (6.2% below target)** 🟡 |
| **Product** | 2,544t | 6,514t | -3,970t | **39.1% (60.9% below target)** 🔴 |
| **Decline** | N/A | N/A | N/A | **No data reported** |

#### Load & Haul Fleet Performance (Truckloads Tipped by Shift)
| Shift | Loads | Target | Performance |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Day | 73 | N/A | **Good** 🟢 |
| Afternoon | 66 | N/A | **Good** 🟢 |
| Night | 68 | N/A | **Good** 🟢 |
| **Total** | **207** | **N/A** | **Consistent Performance** |

#### Blast Performance
- **Unclear Data**: Actual vs Plan ? vs16 - requires clarification

### Equipment Status

#### TMM Availability
| Equipment | Availability | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **DT** | **94%** | 🟢✅ Excellent performance |
| **FL** | **64%** | 🔴 Poor performance - FL66 engine issues |
| **HD** | **98%** | 🟢✅ Excellent performance |
| **RT** | **84%** | 🟡 Good performance |
| **SR** | **90%** | 🟢 Good performance |

**Poor Performance Analysis:**
- **FL**: Critical 64% availability - FL66 engine cut off (machine location unknown and couldn't be attended to on time)

#### Equipment Readiness (Start of Shift)
- **DT**: 9/9 available (100%) 🟢
- **FL**: 5/6 available (83%) 🟡 - FL66 engine cut off
- **HD**: 6/6 available (100%) 🟢
- **RT**: 5/6 available (83%) 🟡 - RT50 brakes locked
- **SR**: 5/6 available (83%) 🟡 - SR25 no movement

### Current Breakdowns (11 Units)

#### Front Loader Equipment Issues
- **FL66**: engine cut off (machine location unknown and hence couldn't be attended to on time)

#### Roof Bolter Equipment Issues
- **RT50**: brakes locked

#### Service Rig Equipment Issues
- **SR25**: no movement

#### Utility Vehicle Equipment Issues
- **UV123**: outrigger and basket
- **UV90**: water pump & timing
- **UV77**: bucket movement
- **UV119**: warning sign
- **UV108**: brakes
- **UV69**: suspension
- **UV84**: articulation pin

#### Grader Equipment Issues
- **GR12**: brakes

### Support Equipment Summary
- **Emulsion UV**: 94% (UV62,66,108) 🟢
- **Logistics UV**: 100% (UV54,59,120) 🟢
- **Sampling UV**: 0% (UV77,123) 🔴 **CRITICAL - Quality control affected**
- **Survey UV**: 100% (UV98,99) 🟢
- **Specialized Equipment**: DZ13 100% 🟢, GD12 0% 🔴

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Fans**: Nothing Reported
- **Plant Blockages**: **2 incidents** 🔴 - twice feeder blocked and needed to be blasted (10:45-11:42 & 17:01-17:34)
- **Fire Alarms**: **2 alarms** 🔴

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear but 2 fire alarms require investigation 🟡
- **Production**: ROM near target but severe product shortfall 🔴
- **Equipment**: Mixed - good DT/HD, poor FL, quality control compromised 🟡
- **Operations**: Plant blockages and fire alarms indicate operational issues 🔴

## Critical Action Items Required

🔴 **PRODUCT OUTPUT INVESTIGATION**: 60.9% shortfall requires immediate investigation - processing/beneficiation issues likely.

🔴 **FIRE ALARM INVESTIGATION**: 2 fire alarms reported - immediate safety investigation required.

🔴 **PLANT BLOCKAGE RESOLUTION**: Feeder required blasting twice - investigate root cause and prevention measures.

🟡 **EQUIPMENT LOCATION MANAGEMENT**: FL66 location unknown causing maintenance delays - improve equipment tracking systems.

🔴 **QUALITY CONTROL**: Sampling UV equipment at 0% availability affecting quality assurance capabilities.

⚠️ **REPORT TIMING**: Address delayed reporting - 4-day gap between data date and submission may indicate operational or communication issues.
