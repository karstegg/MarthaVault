## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear status with no incidents 🟢
- **Production**: ROM target exceeded but product critically below target 🔴
- **Equipment**: Good TMM availability but multiple breakdowns affecting operations ⚠️
- **Operations**: Blast performance severely impacted by emulsion delivery failure 🔴

## Supplemental Information

### ROM Production Correction
**Important**: Initial ROM report of 3,717t was corrected to 7,273t vs target of 6,903t, representing a positive variance of +370t (5.4% above target).

### Blast Operation Issues
Only 7 faces were blasted compared to the planned 16 faces due to emulsion delivery failure. This operational issue directly impacts downstream production capabilities and may affect future production targets.

### Equipment Breakdown Analysis
Multiple breakdowns across different equipment categories indicate potential maintenance scheduling challenges. Key areas of concern:
- **GD12 Grader**: Persistent warranty/brake issues requiring immediate attention
- **Logistics UVs**: 50% availability affecting material transport efficiency
- **TMM Units**: Various mechanical issues affecting production fleet readiness
