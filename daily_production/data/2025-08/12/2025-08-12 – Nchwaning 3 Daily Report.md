## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES - Safety Incident & Production Underperformance

### Safety Status
**INCIDENT REPORTED** - Non-conformance on decline belt chute: Supervisor found on top of conveyor belt without locking out whilst inspecting a blocked chute

### Production Performance
| Metric | Actual | Target | Variance | % of Target |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ROM (tons)** | 6,354 | 8,060 | -1,706 | 78.8% |
| **Decline (tons)** | 4,230 | 5,623 | -1,393 | 75.2% |
| **Product (tons)** | 3,089 | 4,979 | -1,890 | **62.0%** |

#### Load & Haul Fleet Performance (Truckloads Tipped by Shift)
| Shift | Truckloads Tipped |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Day** | 104 |
| **Afternoon** | 80 |
| **Night** | 57 |
| **Total** | **241** |

#### Blast Performance
8 Manganese faces + 3 Waste faces = **11 total faces blasted**

### Equipment Status

#### TMM Availability
| Equipment | Availability | Performance Status |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **HD (Haul Trucks)** | 94% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **DT (Dump Trucks)** | 86% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below Standard |
| **FL (Front Loaders)** | 87% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below Standard |
| **RT (Rock Trucks)** | 89% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **SR (Service Rigs)** | 69% | üî¥ **Poor Performance** |
| **UV (Utility Vehicles)** | 82% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below Standard |

#### Poor Performance Analysis
**SR (Service Rigs)** at 69% availability - **CRITICAL CONCERN**
- Only 2 out of 9 units available for start of shift
- 7 units currently broken down affecting maintenance support

### Support Equipment Summary
| Equipment | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Emulsion UVs** | 4/4 Available |
| **Manlifts** | 4/4 Available |

### Specialized Equipment
| Equipment | Availability |
|-----------|--------------|
| **GD11 (Grader)** | 100% |
| **DZ11 (Dozer)** | 66% |
| **UV044** | 74% |

### Infrastructure Status
| System | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Fire Alarms** | No CCR reports - 06:30 |
| **Crusher Blockages** | x1 at Decline Conveyor Belt |
| **Chute Blockages** | x1 at Decline Conveyor Belt |

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: **CRITICAL** - Safety incident involving lockout/tagout non-conformance on conveyor equipment
- **Production**: Severe underperformance across all metrics with Product at only 62.0% of target (-1,890t shortfall)
- **Equipment**: **POOR** - 16 units broken down, SR fleet critically compromised at 69% availability
- **Operations**: Decline conveyor belt blockage compounding production issues

## Supplemental Information

### Critical Action Items
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Investigate and address lockout/tagout procedures following safety incident
2. **URGENT**: Address Service Rig fleet crisis - only 2/9 units operational
3. **HIGH**: Clear decline conveyor belt blockage affecting operations
4. **HIGH**: Focus maintenance resources on DT and FL fleets to restore production capacity

### Equipment Performance Analysis
- High breakdown count (16 units) significantly impacting production capability
- Service Rig crisis limiting maintenance support across all equipment types
- Strong day shift performance (104 loads) despite equipment constraints suggests operational efficiency when equipment available
