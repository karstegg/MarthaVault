## Actions Required

1. **🔴 URGENT**: Address WINDER CONTROLS ANNUAL INSPECTION FINDINGS REPAIR on Nchwaning 3 Manwinder.
2. **🔴 URGENT**: Prioritize SOLROCK SHAFT BARREL REPAIR PROJECT and SHAFT SURFACE FEEDER LINER REPLACEMENT on Nchwaning 2 Rock Winder.
3. **⚠️ MEDIUM**: Monitor DD02 dam levels due to declining trend.
4. **📊 FOLLOW-UP**: Investigate declining ore pass levels.

## Supplemental Information

### Department Responsibilities
**Shafts & Winders** manages critical infrastructure across all three mine sites:
- **Manwinders**: Personnel transport systems (Nch2 PW, Nch3 PW, GL PW)
- **Rock Winder**: Nchwaning 2 ore hoisting from underground to surface silos (Nch2 RW)
- **Main Fans**: Ventilation systems essential for underground safety
- **Support Infrastructure**: Power supply, lamprooms, and related systems

### Daily Infrastructure Overview
- **Power Systems**: Stable with no stoppages. 🟢
- **Winding Systems**: Nch3 PW and Nch2 RW experiencing critical issues requiring immediate attention. 🔴
- **Ventilation**: All main fans operational. 🟢
- **Safety Systems**: No fire SCADA alarms or block chutes reported. 🟢
- **Water Management**: DD01 dam level good, DD02 requires monitoring. Ore pass levels declining. ⚠️

### Analysis/Trends Section
The primary concern for this report period is the critical maintenance required on the Nchwaning 3 Manwinder and Nchwaning 2 Rock Winder. These issues directly impact personnel transport and ore hoisting, respectively, and require urgent resolution to prevent further operational disruptions. Dam levels are generally stable, though DD02 requires continued monitoring. Ore pass levels show a declining trend, which could indicate potential material flow issues if not addressed.
