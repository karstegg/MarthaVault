- **FL**: 2/2 available (100%) ✅
- **HD**: 2/2 available (100%) ✅
- **RT**: 2/2 available (100%) ✅
- **SR**: 1/2 available (50%) 🔴 - SR46 pump

### Current Breakdowns (6 Units)

#### Production Area Issues
- **FL66**: Propshaft
- **FL102**: Starting
- **RT50**: Transmission (delivery to be made to BRMO today)

- **SR46**: Pump

### Support Equipment Summary
- **Nothing Reported**

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Fans**: Nothing Reported
- **Plant Blockages**: Nothing Reported
- **Fire Alarms**: Nothing Reported

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear operations with no incidents reported ✅
- **Production**: Good ROM performance at 90.3% but significant product gap at 60.8% 🟡
- **Equipment**: 6 units down with FL fleet particularly affected (4/6 available) ⚠️
- **Operations**: Graben area operating at reduced capacity due to equipment issues 🟡

## Supplemental Information

### Report Correction Context
**Data Source Update**: This report has been updated with corrected Friday data from Sikilela Nzuza's weekend report (received Aug 9). Previous data from Johan Kotze showed different production figures.

**Key Differences from Previous Report:**
- **ROM Production**: Improved from 4,137t to 6,235t (90.3% vs 59.9% performance)
- **Product Output**: Revised from 5,492t to 4,031t (60.8% vs 84.3% performance)  
- **Equipment Focus**: Updated breakdown list focusing on TMM fleet issues

### Production Analysis
**Strong Points:**
- **ROM Performance**: Excellent ROM production at 90.3% indicates good underground extraction
- **DT Fleet**: Full production DT availability (9/9 units) supporting operations
- **Safety Status**: Clear operations throughout Friday

**Concerns:**
- **Product Gap**: Significant 60.8% product performance suggests processing challenges
- **FL Fleet Capacity**: Critical issue with only 4/6 FL units available
- **Graben Limitations**: Both DT and SR at 50% availability affecting area productivity

### Equipment Priorities
1. **FL66 Propshaft**: Critical repair for fleet capacity restoration
2. **FL102 Starting System**: Address starting issues for operational reliability
3. **RT50 Transmission**: Scheduled delivery to BRMO for repair
4. **Graben Equipment**: DT176 CAS and SR46 pump repairs for area recovery
