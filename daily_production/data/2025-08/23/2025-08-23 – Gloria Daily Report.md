## Supplemental Information

### Silo Management (Gloria Only)
#### Surface Silos
| Silo | Level | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Silo 1 | 78% | 🟢 Normal operational level |
| Silo 2 | 85% | 🟢 Good operational level |
| Silo 3 | 76% | 🟢 Normal operational level |
| Silo 4 | 89% | 🟢 High operational level |

#### Underground Silos
| Silo | Level | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Silo 74 | 62% | 🟢 Normal ore flow |
| Silo HG | 29% | 🟢 Active ore flow |
| Silo D | 15% | 🟢 High ore throughput |
| Silo LG | 27% | 🟢 Active ore flow |

### Section 54 Safety Notice Impact
**Context**: Following drill rig fire incident at Nchwaning 3, Section 54 safety notice issued restricting all TMM operations pending Principal Inspector feedback and partial upliftment clearance.

**Operational Response**:
- Personnel proceeded underground for pre-starts and awaited further instruction
- Equipment maintained in workshop-ready state for inspections/maintenance
- Non-TMM activities continued as planned
- Production metrics reflect impact of operational restrictions

**Product Performance**: 56% below target primarily attributed to Section 54 restrictions rather than equipment or operational failures.
