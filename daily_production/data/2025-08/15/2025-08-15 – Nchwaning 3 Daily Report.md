**Date**: August 15, 2025 (Data from August 14, 2025)  
**Engineer**: [[Sello Sease]]  
**Site**: Nchwaning 3  

## 🔴🚨 CRITICAL PRODUCTION SHORTFALL

### Safety Status
✅ **CLEAR** - No incidents reported

### Production Performance
🔴 **CRITICAL UNDERPERFORMANCE** - All production metrics severely below target

| Metric | Actual | Target | Variance | Performance |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ROM** | 5,761t | 8,060t | -2,299t | **71.5% (28.5% below target)** 🔴 |
| **Decline** | 3,781t | 7,498t | -3,717t | **50.4% (49.6% below target)** 🔴 |
| **Product** | 3,294t | 6,618t | -3,324t | **49.8% (50.2% below target)** 🔴 |

**Waste Material**: 1,077t additional material handled

#### Load & Haul Fleet Performance (Truckloads Tipped by Shift)
| Shift | Loads | Target | Performance |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Day | 53 | - | **Below normal output** 🔴 |
| Afternoon | 68 | - | **Good output** 🟢 |
| Night | 64 | - | **Moderate output** 🟡 |
| **Total** | **185** | **-** | **Inconsistent performance** |

#### Blast Performance
- **13 Manganese faces, 8 Waste faces, 2 Footwall faces** - Detailed blast data available 🟢

### Equipment Status

#### TMM Availability
| Equipment | Availability | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **DT** | **80%** | 🔴 Critical - poor performance |
| **FL** | **83%** | 🔴 Poor performance |
| **HD** | **92%** | 🟢 Good performance |
| **RT** | **97%** | 🟢✅ Excellent performance |
| **SR** | **66%** | 🔴 Critical - major availability issues |

**Poor Performance Analysis:**
- **SR**: Critical 66% availability - major maintenance backlog and operational issues
- **DT**: Poor 80% availability - fleet reliability concerns affecting primary hauling
- **FL**: Poor 83% availability - secondary hauling capacity compromised

#### Equipment Readiness (Start of Shift)
- **DT**: 11/14 available (79%) 🔴 
- **FL**: 9/10 available (90%) 🟡
- **HD**: 7/9 available (78%) 🔴
- **RT**: 9/10 available (90%) 🟡
- **SR**: 7/10 available (70%) 🔴

### Current Breakdowns (9 Units)

#### Dump Truck Issues
- **DT0145**: Gears & Aircon malfunction

#### Hauler Issues  
- **HD0052**: Water box seals failure

#### Scaler Equipment Issues
- **SR0024**: Boom cracked (structural damage)
- **SR0026**: Brake system failure
- **SR0030**: Incident repairs required

#### Utility Vehicle Issues
- **UV0045**: Not starting (starting system failure)
- **UV0044**: Propshaft malfunction
- **UV0124**: Powerless (electrical system failure)

#### Specialized Equipment Issues
- **DZ0011**: Transmission oil pressure problems

### Support Equipment Summary
- **Manlifts**: 100% 🟢 (4/4 operational)
- **Emulsion UV**: 100% 🟢 (4/4 operational)
- **Specialized Equipment**: GD11 100% 🟢, DZ11 0% 🔴, UV044 0% 🔴

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Fans**: Operational 🟢
- **Plant Blockages**: None 🟢
- **Fire Alarms**: None 🟢
- **Crusher/Chute Blockages**: None 🟢

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear status - no incidents 🟢
- **Production**: Critical underperformance requiring immediate intervention 🔴
- **Equipment**: Major fleet availability issues across multiple equipment types 🔴
- **Operations**: Infrastructure stable but production capacity severely compromised 🔴

## Critical Actions Required

1. **🔴 URGENT**: Address SR fleet availability (66%) - immediate maintenance intervention required
2. **🔴 URGENT**: Investigate DT fleet reliability (80%) - affecting primary hauling capacity  
3. **🔴 URGENT**: Production review meeting - 50% shortfall requires immediate action plan
4. **🔴 HIGH**: Repair DZ11 dozer - completely out of service
5. **🔴 HIGH**: Address UV044 and UV0124 electrical issues
6. **⚠️ MEDIUM**: Review FL fleet maintenance schedule (83% availability)
7. **📊 FOLLOW-UP**: Analyze waste material handling efficiency (1,077t)

## Equipment-Specific BEV Analysis
**Note**: Nchwaning 3 houses all BEV equipment for the operation
- **BEV Status**: All 13 BEV units (7 DTs, 6 FLs) located at Nchwaning 3
- **Impact Assessment**: Poor DT (80%) and FL (83%) availability may be affecting both diesel and BEV fleet performance
- **Recommendation**: Separate BEV vs diesel performance analysis needed
