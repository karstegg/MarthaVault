## 🔴⚠️ PRODUCTION CONSISTENTLY BELOW TARGETS

### Safety Status
✅ **CLEAR** - No incidents reported

### Production Performance
🔴 **ALL PRODUCTION METRICS BELOW TARGET**

| Metric | Actual | Target | Variance | Performance |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ROM** | 3,036t | 3,873t | -837t | **78.4% (below target)** 🔴 |
| **Decline** | 2,881t | 3,873t | -992t | **74.4% (below target)** 🔴 |
| **Product** | 2,970t | 3,894t | -924t | **76.3% (below target)** 🔴 |

#### Load & Haul Fleet Performance (Truckloads Tipped by Shift)
| Shift | Loads | Target | Performance |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Day | 55 | - | **Not Set** ⚪ |
| Afternoon | 28 | - | **Not Set** ⚪ |
| Night | 30 | - | **Not Set** ⚪ |
| **Total** | **113** | **-** | **Same as yesterday** |

#### Blast Performance
- **Nothing Reported**

### Equipment Status

#### TMM Availability
| Equipment | Availability | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **DT** | **89%** | 🟢 Good performance |
| **FL** | **64%** | 🔴 Persistently below optimal threshold |
| **HD** | **85%** | 🟢 Good performance |
| **RT** | **96%** | ✅ Excellent performance |
| **SR** | **100%** | ✅ Outstanding performance |

**Poor Performance Analysis:**
- **FL (Front-end Loaders)**: 64% availability unchanged from yesterday - FL0083 tyre issue requires immediate attention

#### Equipment Readiness (Start of Shift)
- **DT**: 4/6 available (67%) 🔴
- **FL**: 4/5 available (80%) 🟢
- **HD**: 4/4 available (100%) ✅
- **RT**: 4/4 available (100%) ✅
- **SR**: 4/4 available (100%) ✅

### Current Breakdowns (3 Units)

#### FL Equipment Issues
- **FL0083**: Tyre

#### DT Equipment Issues
- **DT0105**: Nerospec
- **DT0173**: Fire suppression

### Support Equipment Summary
- **Emulsion UV**: 100% (2/2) ✅
- **Manlifts**: 100% (2/2) ✅
- **Specialized Equipment**: Manitou 0% (0/1) 🔴 **Unavailable**

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Fans**: In Order ✅
- **Plant Blockages**: None 🟢
- **Fire Alarms**: None 🟢

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear status with no incidents 🟢
- **Production**: All production metrics consistently below targets 🔴
- **Equipment**: Mixed performance with persistent FL equipment issues 🔴
- **Operations**: Infrastructure systems functioning normally 🟢

## Supplemental Information

### Silo Management
#### Surface Silos
| Silo | Level | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Silo 1 | 81% | 🟢 Good Level (unchanged) |
| Silo 2 | 50% | 🟢 Adequate (unchanged) |
| Silo 3 | 17% | ⚠️ Low Level (unchanged) |
| Silo 4 | 17% | ⚠️ Low Level (unchanged) |

#### Underground Silos
| Silo | Level | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Silo 74 | 30% | 🟢 Adequate (unchanged) |
| Silo HG | 23% | ⚠️ Low Level (unchanged) |
| Silo D | 15% | ⚠️ Low Level (unchanged) |
| Silo LG | 20% | ⚠️ Low Level (unchanged) |

### Production Consistency Analysis
**Persistent Underperformance**: Third consecutive day with all production metrics 20-25% below targets, confirming systemic operational challenges rather than daily variations.

**Equipment Performance Stability**: FL availability remains consistently at 64%, indicating ongoing maintenance/operational constraints with front-end loader fleet.

### Equipment Performance Analysis
**FL Equipment Persistent Issues**: FL0083 tyre issue is new but FL availability remains at 64% from yesterday, suggesting one unit repaired while another developed issues, indicating fleet management challenges.

**DT Fleet Safety Concern**: DT0173 fire suppression issue represents critical safety system maintenance requirement that must be prioritized.

### Silo Level Stability
**Static Management**: All silo levels remain identical to yesterday, indicating stable but suboptimal material flow management. Low levels in multiple silos (3, 4, HG, D, LG) suggest ongoing material distribution challenges.

### Operational Pattern Recognition
**Load Performance Consistency**: Identical 113 truckloads for two consecutive days suggests stable operational capacity despite production metric shortfalls, indicating potential processing or target-setting challenges rather than hauling capacity issues.
