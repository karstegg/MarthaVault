**Date**: August 6, 2025 (Data from August 5, 2025)
**Engineer**: [[Sello Sease]]
**Site**: Nchwaning 3

## 🔴🚨 PRODUCTION CRITICALLY BELOW TARGETS - FIRE ALARMS PERSIST

### Safety Status
✅ **CLEAR** - No incidents reported

### Production Performance
🔴 **ALL PRODUCTION METRICS CRITICALLY BELOW TARGET**

| Metric | Actual | Target | Variance | Performance |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ROM** | 4,715t | 8,060t | -3,345t | **58.5% (below target)** 🔴 |
| **Decline** | 4,437t | 7,498t | -3,061t | **59.2% (below target)** 🔴 |
| **Product** | 3,400t | 6,618t | -3,218t | **51.4% (below target)** 🔴 |

#### Load & Haul Fleet Performance (Truckloads Tipped by Shift)
| Shift | Loads | Target | Performance |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Day | 65 | - | **Not Set** ⚪ |
| Afternoon | 90 | - | **Not Set** ⚪ |
| Night | 80 | - | **Not Set** ⚪ |
| **Total** | **235** | **-** | **Highest across all sites** |

#### Blast Performance
- **23 faces blasted (19 Mn + 3 waste + 1 overhang)** ✅

### Equipment Status

#### TMM Availability
| Equipment | Availability | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **HD** | **93%** | 🟢 Excellent performance |
| **DT** | **66%** | 🔴 Critically below optimal threshold |
| **FL** | **96%** | ✅ Outstanding performance |
| **RT** | **78%** | 🔴 Below optimal threshold |
| **SR** | **86%** | 🟢 Good performance |
| **UV** | **88%** | 🟢 Good performance |

**Poor Performance Analysis:**
- **DT (Dump Trucks)**: 66% availability unchanged from yesterday - four breakdown units severely affecting production capacity
- **RT (Roof Bolters)**: 78% availability unchanged from yesterday - power trip issues affecting performance

#### Equipment Readiness (Start of Shift)
- **HD**: 8/9 available (89%) 🟢
- **DT**: 10/14 available (71%) 🔴
- **FL**: 10/10 available (100%) ✅
- **RT**: 9/10 available (90%) 🟢
- **SR**: 9/10 available (90%) 🟢
- **UV**: 8/9 available (89%) 🟢

### Current Breakdowns (9 Units)

#### DT Equipment Issues
- **DT0145**: Oil leak
- **DT0148**: Gears
- **DT0150**: Gears
- **DT0161**: Strata (Speed control)

#### HD Equipment Issues
- **HD0055**: Locked service overdue

#### RT Equipment Issues
- **RT0054**: Power trip

#### SR Equipment Issues
- **SR0030**: Incident

#### UV Equipment Issues
- **UV0045**: FTS
- **UV0047**: Brakes release

### Support Equipment Summary
- **Emulsion UV**: 100% (4/4) ✅
- **Manlifts**: 100% (4/4) ✅
- **Specialized Equipment**: GD11 100% ✅, DZ11 100% ✅, UV044 77% ⚠️

### Infrastructure Status
- **Main Fans**: Nothing Reported
- **Plant Blockages**: None 🟢
- **Fire Alarms**: 3 Active 🔴🚨
  - **Crusher Area**: Sensor faulty
  - **65CV 01**: Fault
  - **Surface MCC**: Fault

## Performance Summary
- **Safety**: Clear incident status but persistent fire alarm system faults critical 🔴
- **Production**: All metrics critically below targets (-40% to -48%) - unchanged severity 🔴
- **Equipment**: DT and RT fleets remain critically compromised 🔴
- **Operations**: Strong blast performance but infrastructure alarms unresolved ⚠️

## Supplemental Information

### Persistent Equipment Crisis Analysis
**DT Fleet Stagnation**: 66% availability unchanged for second consecutive day with identical breakdown units offline:
- **Gear Problems**: DT0148, DT0150 - ongoing mechanical issues
- **Control Systems**: DT0161 strata/speed control - safety-critical system compromise
- **Environmental**: DT0145 oil leak - environmental compliance risk

**RT Fleet Stability**: 78% availability maintained but below optimal threshold, indicating persistent power trip issues with RT0054.

### Fire Alarm System Status - No Improvement
**Critical Safety Infrastructure**: Three active fire alarms persist unchanged from yesterday:
- **Crusher Area**: Sensor fault - detection system reliability compromised
- **65CV 01**: System fault - operational safety impact
- **Surface MCC**: Motor Control Center fault - electrical safety concern

**Safety Management Concern**: No progress on fire alarm resolution indicates potential resource allocation or technical complexity issues requiring escalation.

### Production Performance Consistency
**Stable Underperformance**: Production metrics virtually identical to yesterday:
- **ROM**: 58.5% today vs 58.5% yesterday (unchanged)
- **Product**: 51.4% today vs 51.4% yesterday (unchanged)
- **Pattern**: Suggests systemic constraints rather than daily operational variations

### Load Performance Excellence
**Operational Efficiency**: 235 truckloads represents highest performance across all sites for second consecutive day, indicating:
- **Fleet Utilization**: Maximum use of available equipment
- **Operational Discipline**: Strong shift management despite equipment constraints
- **Capacity Recognition**: Load performance demonstrates potential when equipment available

### Equipment Breakdown Persistence
**Unchanged Breakdown Profile**: Same 9 units offline as yesterday indicates:
- **Maintenance Capacity**: Potential resource constraints in repair capabilities
- **Parts Availability**: Possible supply chain challenges for critical components
- **Priority Management**: May require management intervention for resource allocation
