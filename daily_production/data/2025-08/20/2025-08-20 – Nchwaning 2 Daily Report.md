- **Equipment**: Multiple critical breakdowns affecting operations 🔴
- **Operations**: Plant blockages and fire alarms requiring immediate attention 🔴

## Supplemental Information

### Critical Issues Requiring Attention
1. **Equipment Reliability**: High breakdown count (13 units) affecting operational efficiency
2. **Specialized Equipment**: Sampling UVs completely unavailable
3. **Plant Operations**: Multiple blockages and fire alarms indicate systemic issues
4. **Parts Quality**: RT50 axle failure immediately after installation suggests quality control issues

### Positive Performance Indicators
- Strong blast performance exceeding plan
- Excellent DT and HD availability
- Product production ahead of target
- Consistent load delivery performance
