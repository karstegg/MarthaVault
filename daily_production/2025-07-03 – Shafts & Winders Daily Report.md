| Thursday | - | Pending |

**Analysis:** ⚠️ DD02 showing declining trend from 88.5% (Monday) to 83.5% (Wednesday)

## Production Context
**Shaft Barrel Repair Project** ongoing with production impact:

| Day | Production | Target | Performance |
|-----|------------|--------|-------------|
| Friday | 183t | - | Project impact |
| Saturday | 0t | 1,640t | Project shutdown |
| Sunday | 1,276t | 1,640t | 77.8% recovery |

**Project Impact:** Significant production reduction due to shaft barrel repair work. Sunday showed partial recovery with 1,276t vs 1,640t target.

## Key Performance Indicators

### Infrastructure Reliability
- **Power Systems:** 100% uptime
- **Main Fans:** 100% operational
- **Lamprooms:** 100% operational
- **Winders:** 75% fully operational (Nch2 RW oil leak resolved)

### Critical Monitoring
- ✅ Zero fire SCADA alarms
- ✅ No block chute incidents
- ⚠️ DD02 dam declining trend needs monitoring
- ✅ Oil leak repair completed quickly

## Analysis & Recommendations

### Positive Indicators
- All critical infrastructure systems operational
- Safety status clear with zero alarms
- Quick response to Nch2 RW oil leak
- DD01 dam maintaining optimal levels

### Areas of Concern
1. **DD02 Dam Trend:** Declining from 88.5% to 83.5% over 3 days
2. **Production Impact:** Shaft Barrel Repair Project causing significant throughput reduction
3. **Winder Maintenance:** Oil leak indicates potential need for preventive maintenance review

### Recommendations
1. **Monitor DD02 dam levels** closely - investigate consumption patterns
2. **Continue tracking** Shaft Barrel Repair Project progress and production recovery
3. **Preventive maintenance review** on other winder oil systems to prevent similar leaks
4. **Capacity planning** for post-project production ramp-up
