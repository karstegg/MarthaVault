# HD0054 Major Fire Incident Report
**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Time**: 03:00 SAST  
**Location**: Nchwaning 3 Underground  
**Equipment**: HD0054 (Hydraulic Drill)  
**Incident Type**: Catastrophic Engine Fire  
**Severity**: Major - Total Equipment Loss  

## üî• INCIDENT SUMMARY
**Catastrophic engine fire resulting in total machine loss**

### Timeline of Events
- **Start of Shift**: Mechanic topped up 2.5 liters water/coolant due to overheating issues
- **03:00+**: Operator completed drilling, machine cut out on return to waiting place
- **03:0X**: Operator exited to report engine cut out to control room
- **03:0X**: Colleague walking past observed smoke from machine
- **03:0X**: Called operator back - machine already in flames
- **03:0X**: Emergency evacuation, reported to control supervisor
- **03:0X**: Control room emergency call initiated
- **05:00-06:00**: Emergency control room established, prototeam deployed
- **All Day**: Ventilation fan issues discovered - main evacuation fan offline
- **16:00**: Fans restored, gas levels acceptable (below 6 ppm vs 30 ppm limit)
- **16:00+**: Underground assessment commenced
- **Ongoing**: Investigation activities

## üö® SAFETY STATUS
‚úÖ **NO INJURIES** - All personnel safe  
üî¥ **OPERATIONAL IMPACT** - Lost time for smoke clearance and inspection  
üî¥ **EQUIPMENT LOSS** - HD0054 completely destroyed  

## üìã INCIDENT DETAILS

### Equipment Information
- **Unit**: HD0054
- **Type**: Hydraulic Drill
- **Location**: Nchwaning 3 Underground
- **Status**: Total Loss - Machine completely burned down

### Operational Context
- **Pre-incident**: Overheating issues noted, 2.5L coolant added at start of shift
- **Operations**: Normal drilling operations completed successfully
- **Return Journey**: Machine cut out while returning to waiting area
- **Initial Response**: Operator exited to report mechanical issue to control room
- **Discovery**: Colleague observed smoke, alerted operator
- **Escalation**: Machine already fully engulfed when operator returned
- **Damage**: Complete destruction - tires, cable rail, entire machine burned

### Response Actions
- **Immediate**: Operator evacuation (safe), reported to control supervisor
- **Emergency**: Control room emergency protocols activated at 03:00+
- **05:00-06:00**: Emergency control room established, prototeam deployed
- **Critical Issue**: Main evacuation fan offline, secondary issues with ventilation
- **Extended**: All-day smoke clearance operations (gas monitoring)
- **16:00**: Fans restored, CO levels reduced to 6 ppm (limit: 30 ppm)
- **Safety**: Underground assessment commenced once safe levels achieved

## üîç INVESTIGATION STATUS
**ONGOING** - Investigation currently in progress

### Key Investigation Areas
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Engine compartment fire origin and overheating issues
2. **Maintenance History**: Pre-incident equipment condition and coolant issues
3. **Operational Factors**: Drilling operations and return journey procedures
