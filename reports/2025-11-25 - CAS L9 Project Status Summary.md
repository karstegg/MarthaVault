- **Challenges**: LDO558 none commissioned (parkbrake doesn't allow recycle on L9, struggling with tag to start LDV - AARD one of oldest); LDO591 breakdown (requires SD card); LDO614 outstanding (permanent stop from CWS); LDO628 low battery
- **Comments**: AARD is one of oldest on site

**19/11**
- **Work Done**: LDO626 fully setup (Strata/Nero); CR0104/CR0105 assistance with installation
- **Challenges**: LDO626 (switching off supply when parkbrake released - faulty isolator); LDO615 (servo losing power when accelerator pressed); LDO566/LDO602 (one programming cable, machines available 11am); LDO592 (Ausco braking red light doesn't switch off)
- **Comments**: Mine auto electrician consulted. Suggestion to install split charging unit connections before commissioning LDO615

**20/11**
- **Work Done**: LDO602 80% commissioned; LDO566 collected for isolator repair
- **Challenges**: LDO602 (alternator fault, batteries not charging, voltage constant 10v, brakes failing); LDO566 (not brought to testing area); NCHW2/3 (split charging units not connected)
- **Comments**: LDO602 informed chargehand. Sipho to address LDO566. Split charging cables blocking multiple units

**21/11**
- **Work Done**: Preparation of LDVs for commissioning
- **Challenges**: NCH3 LD615/LD626 (low power issues); LDVs (power issues on two units); Epiroc machine (Manitou team resistance to breakdown work)

**22/11**
- **Work Done**: LDO563 progress (parkbrake recycle issues sorted)
- **Challenges**: LDO567 (requires new hub); LDO563/558/602/567/646/614 (Gloria breakdowns, NCH2 wifi config fault)
