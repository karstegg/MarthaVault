## CONSOLIDATED PROJECT SUMMARY

**Total Equipment Tracked Across All OEMs**: 88 units

**Equipment Status Breakdown**:
- **L9 Completed**: 50 units (57%)
  - Strata: 22 units
  - Nerospec: 13 units
  - Aard: 5 units
  - Fermel: 1 unit
  - Manitou: 0 units

- **Ready for CoC**: 1 unit (Strata - LD0506)

- **In Progress**: 34 units (39%)
  - Nerospec: 10 units
  - Fermel: 10 units
  - Strata: 8 units
  - Aard: 4 units
  - Manitou: 2 units (pending/on hold)

**Critical Blockers Across All OEMs**:
1. **Resource Constraints**:
   - Strata technician shortage (NCH2, Gloria) - only 1 team per shaft
   - Nerospec split charging cable availability - blocking multiple LDV commissioning
   - Fermel CoC bottleneck - limited availability windows

2. **Equipment-Specific Issues**:
   - LD0483 (Gloria/Strata): Breakdown since Nov 17; Prox-mod changed, needs underground brackets
   - LD0506 (Gloria/Strata/Fermel): Multiple systems issues; flasher unit installation pending
   - LD0614 (NCH3/Strata/Nerospec): Permanent Stop input coordination issue with CWS
   - LDO566, LDO602 (Gloria/Nerospec): Programming cable availability constraint
   - Various Nerospec LDVs: Power/charging/communication faults

3. **Schedule Risk**:
   - DMRE Deadline: December 31, 2025 (36 days remaining)
   - 34 units still in progress or pending
   - Estimated 2-3 units/week commissioning rate based on current trends
