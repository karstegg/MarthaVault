**Note on Epiroc and CAT:**
No direct messages were found from or about "Epiroc" or "CAT" themselves, only references to Epiroc machines or specific CAT equipment numbers (like DT 157) in messages from other entities. The feedback for these OEMs would be indirect, through the context of Strata or Nerospec reports if their equipment was mentioned in a status update.

This comprehensive summary should provide all the necessary information for your weekly progress update.
