# Mechanical Audit summary at N3
Here’s a concise roll-up of the audit, highlighting the biggest issues by fleet. Counts in brackets show how many times that issue appeared in your findings.

| Fleet  | Key issues (highlights)                                                                                                                                                                               | FSS status                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **DT** | Linear heat-detect wire issues **(5)**; Oil leaks/contamination **(5)**; Coolant issues **(2)**; Fuel caps/lines **(1)**; Belly-plate oil/residue **(5)**; Batteries/terminals **(1)**                | **expired (2)**, **no sticker (1)**, **NO-GO (3)** |
| **DZ** | Oil leaks/contamination **(4)**; Hydraulic leaks **(1)**                                                                                                                                              | **expired (1)**                                    |
| **FL** | Oil leaks/contamination **(9)**; Electrical wiring/labels **(6)**; Hydraulic leaks **(5)**; Batteries/terminals **(4)**; Diesel leaks **(3)**; Coolant issues **(3)**                                 | **expired (1)**, **due (1)**                       |
| **GD** | Oil leaks/contamination **(2)**; Hydraulic leaks **(1)**                                                                                                                                              | OK / minor                                         |
| **RT** | Oil leaks/contamination **(7)**; Hydraulic leaks **(4)**; Batteries/terminals **(2)**; Grease system **(2)**; Electrical wiring/labels **(1)**; Tappet cover **(1)**                                  | **expired (3)**                                    |
| **SR** | Linear heat-detect wire issues **(5)**; Oil leaks/contamination **(4)**; Hydraulic leaks **(2)**; Belly-plate oil/residue **(2)**; Fuel caps/lines **(1)**; Electrical wiring/labels **(1)**          | **expired (3)**, **NO-GO (3)**                     |
| **UV** | Articulation leaks/dry pins **(5)**; Oil leaks/contamination **(4)**; Electrical wiring/labels **(2)**; Linear wire **(1)**; Diesel leaks **(1)**; Batteries/terminals **(1)**; Grease system **(1)** | **due (1)**                                        |

Quick read:

- **Highest risk (FSS):** DT, SR, RT show expired/NO-GO states—treat as immediate compliance items.
    
- **Frequent mechanical risks:** Oil/hydraulic leaks across all fleets; **linear heat-wire routing** problems concentrated on DT & SR; **battery/termination** issues notable on FL & RT; **UV articulation** leaks/dry pins stand out.
