# Kenru Fire Meeting - October 1, 2025

**Meeting**: Kenru Fire Protection - OEM Service Quality Response
**Date**: Wednesday, October 1, 2025, 11:00
**Location**: Black Rock Executive Conference Room

**Attendees:**
- **BRMO**: Rudi Opperman (SGM), Greg Karsten (Senior Production Engineer), Lourens van Heerden (Supply Chain Manager)
- **Kenru/Advanced Fire Suppression**: Armand Barnard (CEO), Matt Jacobsz (GM Western Region), Willem van Lingen (GM Kenru), Hans Geertsema (Operations Manager), Gerhard Badenhorst (Branch Manager Kathu)

## Background Context

- S2 drill rig fire incident exposed shortcomings in Kenru's on-site service quality and supervision
- Assmang expressed dissatisfaction with service delivery
- BRMO has ~445 units requiring inspection and servicing (legal obligation)
- Kenru operating with only 3 technician-helper teams + 1 supervisor (insufficient)
- Supervisor now acting as technician = lack of oversight + increased fire risk

## Key Issues Raised

### Fire System Concerns
- Heat shielding on discharge wires not updated on all systems (previous incident at Kunene)
- Need verification that all systems have proper shielding
- S2 systems being upgraded with additional nozzles + LVS (liquid system)

### Design & Risk Assessment
- Each system type must have signed-off design specs for testing
- System design must be based on risk assessment
- Different system types: SCHN, MS1, 110, 210, MS2 Plus (ISO certified)
- Major component changes require recommissioning before machine release

### New Machine Commissioning
- Risk assessment process needed before commissioning
- CAT or Kenru must certify new machines (not Ansul/Jobuk alone)
