# Kenru Fire Meeting - October 29, 2025 (Follow-up to Oct 1 Meeting)

**Location**: Black Rock Mining Operations
**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Attendees**: Greg Karsten, Rudi Opperman, Hans Geertsema, Willem van Lingen, Gerhard Badenhorst (Kenru), plus site engineers (Johan, Quintin, William)

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **System Activation Failures - URGENT**
- **UV 59**: System activated but NO discharge (2 days after Kenru rerouted wires next to exhaust - melted)
  - Machine could still start (safety violation - should cut power)
  - Canister suspected hardened/compacted
  - Conflicting reports: vibration vs. calcification
  - **Status**: 2 weeks without proper report

- **LDO 577**: System activated on Sunday, went off - machine stood without recharge for 2-3 days
  - Kenru had no LVS recharge unit available
  - Hans stepped in to resolve

- **RT 40**: System activated Oct 13 but didn't discharge (only showed activation)

- **ZC 182**: Brand new machine from Van der Walt
  - Multiple plugs not connected correctly
  - Nozzles blocked (against SA standards)
  - No Kenru verification before handover
  - Missing commissioning sign-off

### 2. **Service Quality & Supervision Failures**
- Poor follow-up from management (Hans, Wilhelm)
- Field reports being signed off without proper oversight
- Foreman William noting issues not getting fixed
- **Action Taken**: One technician suspended pending investigation

### 3. **Staffing Crisis**
- Only 3 technician-helper teams + 1 supervisor (insufficient for 445+ units)
- Supervisor now acting as technician (no oversight)
- Missing staff for breakdowns, inspections, commissioning
- Permanent technician implementation: **Monday** (this week)
- Additional teams: **5 technicians + 5 assistants by end of November**
- 2 additional teams already appointed, awaiting police clearance
- Administrator starting within 30 days

### 4. **Contractual & PO Issues**
- **No signed contract yet** (previous contract lapsed)
- Monthly POs arriving on 20th of month = 20 days lost per month
- Backlogs piling up due to PO delays
- **Immediate Fix**: Monthly PO process must be established
- **Scope Revision**: Needs addendum for monthly + quarterly service levels

### 5. **Commissioning & Handover Gaps**
- New machines coming from Van der Walt with Ansul/Jobuk installation
- No Kenru involvement in commissioning = no ownership
- CAT supposed to certify systems but not being done consistently
- **New Protocol**: Gerhard to verify new machines on-site before release

## Key Decisions & Corrective Actions

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**

| Action | Responsible | Deadline |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Report on failed systems (UV 59, RT 40, LDO 577) | Kenru (Quintin/Hans) | Before Friday |
| Full vehicle list with system types | Kenru | Before Friday |
| Test activation without discharge (cartridge test) | Gerhard + Kenru | Immediate |
| Resolve office/admin setup location | Michael (BRMO) + Kenru | Move within 2 weeks |
| Permanent technician on-site | Willem | Monday (Nov 4) |
| Request scope & contract addendum | Willem/Hans | Send mail asap |

### **Short-term (2 weeks)**

- Complete rectifications list by **November 11** (Quintin committed)
- 5 new technician appointments finalized
- Police clearance for additional staff
- Administrator starting in 30 days
- Scope addendum signed for contract

### **Medium-term (by Nov 30)**

- All 5 technicians + 5 assistants on-site (fully staffed)
- 3rd team for breakdowns operational
- Inspection team functional
- Service team expanded from 2 to multiple teams
- Office containerized with electricity, Wi-Fi

### **Ongoing**

- Monthly KPI reviews with Engineering
- Biweekly VFL and PTO meetings
- Quarterly QC inspections (100% coverage annually)
- Fire Prevention Specialist (MSDSA) oversight - **rotation model**: Service site, then 3rd party inspect, repeat 6 months, then annual only

## System Verification Plan

### **Testing Protocol** (to verify systems work)
1. Cartridge test without full discharge
2. Sieve powder for compaction
3. Check all system types (SCHN, MS1, 110, 210, MS2 Plus)
4. Verify activation without unintended starts
5. Pressure checks and nozzle verification

### **New Commissioning Process**
- Gerhard verifies all new machines on-site
- Kenru must sign-off commissioning certificate
- Risk assessment required per system design
- Major component changes = system recommission required
- S2 design already updated with additional nozzles + LVS (liquid system)

---

## Scope & Design Updates

### **Fire System Types at BRMO**
- SCHN (older systems)
- MS1 (older systems)
- 110
- 210
- MS2 Plus (ISO certified)

**Action**: Document each system type with risk assessment and signed-off design specs for testing procedures.

### **Heat Shielding Issue**
- Previous incident: Wheel dozer fire at Kenru (tire struck power cable → arc → fuel line ignition)
- Electronic activation wires burned off (took 17-20 seconds)
- **Sibanya Standard**: New wiring protection required
- **Action**: Verify ALL systems have heat shielding on discharge wires

### **New Inspection Checklist** (3-tier system)
1. **Technician Monthly Service**: Photo/video/voice clip (15 sec) documentation
   - Nozzles in place & direction correct
   - Wires intact
   - Panel lights on
   - Pressure within spec
   - Report any hydraulic leaks, oil leaks

2. **Quintin's Quarterly Over-inspection**: Detailed check of same items

3. **Greg's Bi-weekly Random Check**: Detailed inspection + fire risk assessment

### **Fire Risk Assessment Additions** (to be included by MSDSA)
- Open electrical wires near heat source?
- Is engine cold-side wiring isolated from hot surfaces?
- Fuel line routing away from heat sources?
- Cable protection adequate?
- Accumulator available for nozzle cleaning?

**Note**: New machines require commissioning by CAT (paid) OR Kenru on-site (ownership model).

## Outstanding Issues Requiring Follow-up

1. **Contract & Scope Addendum**
   - Need mail from Kenru with updated scope (monthly + quarterly)
   - Must include: # teams, service frequency, pricing, new machines commissioning process
   - Engineering must approve before signature

2. **Failed System Reports**
   - UV 59: Full RCA + what went wrong
   - RT 40: Full details
   - LDO 577: Why no spares available?
   - Reports must go to Quintin/Hans, not just helpers

3. **System Activation Testing**
   - Need list of ALL systems that need activation/pressure verification
   - Plan for cartridge testing without powder discharge
   - Timeline for completion

4. **New Machine Commissioning**
   - ZC 181/182 follow-up: Who will sign-off?
   - CAT involvement? Or Kenru on-site with Gerhard?
   - Process definition needed

5. **MSDSA Involvement**
   - Confirm start date for fire prevention specialist
   - Rotation model: Service → Inspect → Annual
   - Training content for technicians on fire risk identification

## Key Learnings & Accountability

### **What Went Wrong**
- Insufficient staffing (3 teams for 445+ units)
- Lack of supervision/oversight
- Poor follow-up from management
- No ownership of new machine commissioning
- Wiring installed next to hot surfaces without verification
- Field reports signed without verification

### **How We Fix It**
- Permanent on-site person with supervisory authority
- Expanded team (5+5 by Nov 30)
- 3-tier inspection system with accountability
- Signed-off checklists and risk assessments
- 3rd party monthly oversight (rotating in/out model)
- New machine commissioning process with sign-off

### **What Success Looks Like**
- All systems tested & verified working
- No activation failures
- Monthly KPI reviews showing trend improvement
- 6-month clean report from MSDSA
- Full staffing by Nov 30
- Quarterly 100% coverage of all units
