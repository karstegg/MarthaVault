## 3. Fault Finding & Resolution

### Evolution of Fault Finding

1.  **2025-05-13**: Initial investigation pointed to a faulty EGR and fuel pressure sensor.
2.  **2025-05-14**: Error code 2061 (AFC) was triggered. The EGR value was not responding, leading to a suspicion of a faulty ECU.
3.  **2025-05-25**: The engine was not starting. The low pressure sensor and rail pressure were identified as issues, and the high-pressure pump was marked for replacement.
4.  **2025-05-27**: The EGR and Rail were replaced, but a "water in fuel" error persisted.
5.  **2025-05-28**: The engine was still not starting. The fuel pump, fuel rail, and injectors were replaced.
6.  **2025-05-29**: A final EGR error code on the ECU led to the replacement of the ECU itself, which was then loaded with the correct hex file.

### Final Resolution

The issue was fully resolved by replacing the following components:
- EGR Valve
- Fuel Rail
- Fuel Pump
- Injectors
- ECU
