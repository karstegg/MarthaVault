# Motivation for Additional Foreman - N3 Underground Electrical Section

**Prepared by:** Gregory Karsten, Senior Production Engineer  
**Date:** 05 November 2025  
**Site:** Nchwaning 3 Underground Operations

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document motivates the critical need for an additional Foreman position in the Nchwaning 3 Underground Electrical Section. Current operational scope has expanded significantly beyond manageable capacity for a single-foreman structure, creating compliance risks, productivity bottlenecks, and safety concerns across a 3-4km diameter underground operation.

**Key Recommendation:** Appoint Construction Crew Foreman to manage infrastructure installation, minisub upgrades, and forward-moves, allowing existing foreman to focus on breakdown response and legal compliance.

---

## CURRENT OPERATIONAL SCOPE

### Infrastructure Scale
- **70+ Minisubs** (distribution substations)
- **350+ Gulley boxes** (local distribution points)
- **140 Fans** (ventilation systems)
- **50 Submersible pumps** (dewatering)
- **10+ km LED lighting** (access and production areas)
- **3-4 km operational diameter** (extreme geographical spread)

### Production Equipment Support
- **3 Major production sections** (active mining areas)
- **1 Development section** (advancing infrastructure)
- **12 Drill rigs** (production drilling)
- **12 Roofbolters** (ground support)
- **13 BEVs** (Battery Electric Vehicles - separate electrician team)

### Fixed Plant Infrastructure
- **2 Old tips** (legacy infrastructure)
- **2 Satellite tips** with 13 rock breakers
- **Multiple conveyors, feeders, crusher, screens**
- **Compressed air reticulation network**

### Workshop Facilities
- **3 Workshop sections:**
  - Load & Haul (L&H)
  - Drill & Blast (D&B)
  - Utility Vehicles (UV)
- **BEV Bay** (specialized BEV servicing area)

---

## CURRENT STRUCTURE LIMITATIONS

### **Current Single-Foreman Model:**
**Day/Night Shift Crew (rotating):**
- 1x Chargehand
- 4x Electricians
- 2x Semi-Skilled
- 1x UV Operator
- 5x Cable Attendants

**Responsibilities:**
- All breakdown repairs across entire mine
- Legal inspections (substations, mini subs, conveyors, pumps, gulley boxes, 6m e/l tests)
- Plant maintenance (TMM, infrastructure)
- Forward moves (power, lighting, leaky feeder, blasting boxes)
- Plan & install minisubs
- Install gulley boxes, fans, pumps, lighting
- PMs on substations, conveyors, and offices

### **Critical Bottlenecks:**
1. **Single UV operator** for entire 3-4km operation
2. **No dedicated construction/installation capacity**
3. **Reactive breakdown response competes with proactive installation**
4. **Limited equipment** (1x scissor lift for all overhead work)
5. **Foreman overload** managing both urgent repairs and planned construction

---

## BUSINESS CASE & JUSTIFICATION

### **1. Legal Compliance Risk Mitigation**

**Current Risk:** Single foreman cannot adequately supervise compliance across:
- 70 minisub inspections
- 350+ gulley box inspections
- 140 fan inspections & maintenance
- 50 pump inspections
- 6-month e/l tests
- Conveyor legal inspections
- Substation legal inspections

**Mitigation:** Dedicated construction foreman ensures forward-planning of legal inspections while breakdown foreman maintains reactive compliance.

### **2. Production Enablement**

**Current Constraint:** Breakdowns pull crew away from critical infrastructure expansion, delaying:
- Development section advance (power supply delays)
- Production section expansions (lighting, ventilation delays)
- Equipment relocations (minisub relocations block production moves)

**Improvement:** Construction crew maintains planned installation schedule independent of breakdown events, enabling production advance cadence.

### **3. Safety & Risk Reduction**

**Current Risks:**
- Single UV operator creates access bottlenecks in emergencies
- Rushed installations due to competing priorities
- Inadequate supervision across 3-4km spread
- Crew fatigue from reactive/proactive task switching

**Improvements:**
- Dedicated UV operator per crew ensures emergency response capacity
- Construction crew can focus on quality installations without rush
- Each foreman supervises manageable geographical area
- Specialized crews develop expertise and efficiency

### **4. Operational Efficiency**

**Current Inefficiencies:**
- **Context switching:** Crew pivots between breakdown response and construction
- **Equipment contention:** Single scissor lift shared across all activities
- **Travel time:** 3-4km operational diameter with single crew
- **Planning disruption:** Forward moves delayed by unplanned breakdowns

**Efficiency Gains:**
- **Parallel operations:** Breakdowns handled while construction continues
- **Reduced travel:** Specialized crews can work closer to dedicated areas
- **Better planning:** Construction crew maintains predictable schedule
- **Skill development:** Crews specialize and improve efficiency

### **5. Infrastructure Expansion Support**

**Future Requirements:**
- BEV infrastructure expansion (13 BEVs currently, growing fleet)
- Additional production sections (mining expansion plans)
- Aging infrastructure replacement (70+ minisubs, 350+ gulley boxes)
- Leaky feeder network expansion (communication infrastructure)

**Capacity:** Current single-foreman model already at capacity before expansion requirements.

## CONCLUSION

The current single-foreman model at N3 Underground Electrical Section has reached operational capacity limits. The scale and complexity of infrastructure (70 minisubs, 350+ gulley boxes, 140 fans, 10km+ lighting, 3-4km operational spread) combined with production support requirements (12 drill rigs, 12 roofbolters, 3 production sections, 1 development section) and legal compliance obligations create an unsustainable workload for a single supervisory layer.

**The appointment of a Construction & Infrastructure Foreman is not a luxury—it is an operational necessity to:**
1. Maintain legal compliance and avoid regulatory sanctions
2. Enable production advance without infrastructure delays
3. Reduce safety risks through adequate supervision
4. Develop organizational resilience and succession capacity
5. Support future growth and infrastructure expansion

**Recommendation:** Approve immediate recruitment of Construction & Infrastructure Foreman for N3 Underground Electrical Section, targeting January 2026 start date.
