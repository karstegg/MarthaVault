## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ESCALATIONS THIS WEEK

### Contract Termination
- **Epiroc SLA**: 84% - **Contract stopped. Pack to be archived**
- Major contract relationship change requiring executive attention

### DT171 Extended Failure - 10+ Days
- **Total downtime**: 10D23H27min (254+ hours)
- **Root cause**: Hydraulic valve block cracked (17/08/2025)
- **Parts status**: Delivered 25/08/2025 but **NOT received underground**
- **Stores policy**: Refused breakdown order, forced normal line haul delivery
- **Impact**: Single unit responsible for massive availability loss

## Team Structure
*No changes from previous weeks*

## Critical Issues Summary

### BEV Critical Issues (Deteriorating)
- **ST14 bucket audit**: Still pending - condition continues to worsen
- **Mirror bracket solution**: Implementation in progress
- **Critical spares meeting**: Waiting on Black Rock response for meeting date
- **DT150**: Long standing times due to support equipment/tools needed
- **DT171**: **Parts delivered but logistical failure underground delivery**

### New Equipment Issues This Week
- **DT150**: 22+ hours breakdown - recurring neutral gear issue (door limit switch)
- **FL113**: 1+ day tyre breakdown
- **DT147**: Multiple tyre issues (solenoid valve replacement)
- **DT163**: Seat damaged by electrical short - replacement required
- **FL99**: BMS fault with broken pack plug insulator

### CAS L9 Implementation (No Progress)
- **DT109**: **Still limited to 1st gear only** - 3+ weeks unresolved

### Certiq & Mobilaris (Status Quo)
- **NCH3 contract**: Still expired - no resolution
- **NCH2**: Same numbers as previous week (no progress)
- **Gloria**: Same numbers as previous week (no progress)

## Charger Infrastructure Crisis

### New Module Failures (Week 3)
- **Charger 4**: Module 1 removed (faulty, needs replacement)
- **Charger 5**: Module 4 removed (faulty, needs replacement)  
- **Charger 7**: One module switched off (trips mini sub breaker)
- **Charger 8**: One module switched off (trips mini sub breaker)

### Connector Cable Deterioration
- **Posts 3, 6, and 7**: CCS connector cables need replacement
- **Infrastructure degradation accelerating** - more components failing

### Weekly Comparison - Charger Status
- **Week 1**: Charger 7 Module 4, Charger 1 fan
- **Week 2**: Same issues, no progress
- **Week 3**: **4 additional modules failing**, cable replacements needed

## Battery Status (Minor Improvements)
- **VPY-00031**: Still breakdown, waiting TMS replacement
- **VPX-00015**: Battery on surface, waiting to go down
- **Same ratios maintained**: 1.6 batteries per machine target

## Major Equipment Failures Timeline

### DT171 - The 10+ Day Crisis
- **17/08/2025**: Initial hydraulic valve block crack
- **Week 1**: 3D21H40min - Parts ordered
- **Week 2**: 5D23H27min - Still waiting parts  
- **25/08/2025**: Parts delivered from Epiroc
- **Week 3**: **10D23H27min - Parts not received underground**

### Other Significant Failures
- **DT150**: 22H25min - Boisy fault finding, recurring neutral issue
- **FL113**: 1D20H52min - Tyre replacement delays
- **DT147**: 1D03H07min - Bucket tipping and tailgate issues
- **FL99**: BMS fault recovery, temporary fix applied

## Maintenance Schedule (Sept 2025)
| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|---------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1-Sep-25 | 2-Sep-25 | 3-Sep-25 | 4-Sep-25 | 5-Sep-25 |
| DT0161 | DT0163 | DT0148 | DT0171 | DT0150 |
| FL0113 | FL0091 | FL0107 | FL0101 | FL0056 |

## Passport 360 Compliance
- **All rates unchanged** from previous weeks except:
- **Epiroc SLA**: 84% - **Contract stopped. Pack to be archived**

## Planned Work (Coming Week)
- **DC/DC campaign**: Artisan onboarding continues (3+ weeks mentioned)
- **NEW**: S2 engine software standardisation to be completed

## Trending Analysis - Week 3

### Catastrophic Deterioration
1. **Single equipment failure impact**: DT171 alone accounts for 254+ hours lost
2. **Contract relationship breakdown**: Major vendor contract terminated
3. **Infrastructure failure acceleration**: Charger modules failing faster than repairs
4. **Parts logistics failure**: Even when parts arrive, delivery systems failing

### Persistent Systemic Issues
1. **DT109**: 3+ weeks unresolved, no escalation apparent
2. **Stores policy conflicts**: Continuing to cause extended delays
3. **Contract management**: Multiple expired/terminated agreements
4. **Proactive maintenance**: No evidence of preventive strategies

### Critical Success Factors Missing
1. **Executive intervention**: Major failures not triggering senior management response
2. **Parts logistics**: Underground delivery systems inadequate
3. **Vendor relationship management**: Contract terminations suggest relationship issues
4. **Equipment redundancy**: Single unit failures causing disproportionate impact

## Risk Assessment
- **ðŸ”´ EXTREME**: Parts logistics and vendor relationship deterioration
- **ðŸ”´ HIGH**: Infrastructure degradation accelerating faster than maintenance capacity
- **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM**: Equipment reliability declining but some units stable
- **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM**: Battery management improving slightly

*This week represents the most concerning report in the series with multiple systemic failures and relationship breakdowns requiring immediate executive attention.*
