# BRMO Weekly Report Summary (14-20 Aug 2025)
*Management Summary for Departmental Weekly Report*

**Source**: [[2025-08-14 â€“ BRMO Weekly Report Reference]]  
**Period**: 14 August 2025 - 20 August 2025  
**Previous Week**: [[2025-08-06 â€“ BRMO Weekly Report Summary]]

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ALERTS
- **NCH3 Certiq & Mobilaris support contract EXPIRED** - Immediate contract renewal required
- **Multiple multi-day equipment failures** - Significant availability impact
- **Parts procurement policy conflicts** - Delaying critical repairs

## BEV Fleet Performance Metrics

### Availability Percentages
*Calculated from daily utilization data*

**DT BEV Fleet**: *[Estimated significantly below target due to extended failures]*
- Target: 85%
- Actual: *~60-65% (estimated from breakdown data)*
- Status: **ðŸ”´ WELL BELOW TARGET**
- **Key Impact**: DT171 (3+ days), DT147 (2+ days), DT150 (1+ day)

**FL BEV Fleet**: *[Also below target due to major failures]*
- Target: 85%
- Actual: *~70-75% (estimated from breakdown data)*
- Status: **ðŸŸ¡ BELOW TARGET**
- **Key Impact**: FL108 (2+ days), FL113 (21+ hours)

## Key Breakdown Analysis (Left Column)

### DT BEV Critical Performance Issues
- **Multi-day hydraulic failure** (DT171) - 3+ days waiting for parts due to stores policy
- **Extended tyre repairs** (DT147) - 2+ days for tyre changes, indicating process issues
- **BMS errors escalating** (DT150) - Battery subpack replacement required (VPX-24)
- **Persistent battery connection issues** (DT146) - Recurring over multiple weeks
- **Transport constraints** - Repairs delayed due to underground access limitations

### FL BEV Critical Performance Issues  
- **Extended inverter failures** (FL108) - 2+ days with additional damage events
- **Chronic clutch pressure issues** (FL113) - 21+ hours continuous problems
- **Recurring STRATA dependencies** - Third-party system causing repeated issues
- **Bucket condition deteriorating** - ST14 machines requiring immediate audit
- **TCU errors increasing** - Control unit failures suggesting systemic issues

## Key Battery Themes (Right Column)

### Charging Infrastructure (No Improvement)
- **Persistent charger module failures** - Same issues as previous week, no progress
- **Continued connector degradation** - Charger stops increasing, no remedial action
- **Fan replacement delays** - Same faulty units affecting charging capacity
- **NO PROGRESS ON INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIRS** - Critical maintenance backlog growing

### Critical Maintenance Escalation
- **BMS error patterns emerging** - Multiple units showing battery management issues
- **Subpack replacement required** - DT150 VPX-24 battery failure indicates wider concern
- **Parts procurement policy conflict** - Stores refusing breakdown orders, forcing delays
- **DC/DC campaign stalled** - No concrete progress despite repeated mentions

### Operational Challenges (Deteriorating)
- **Extended failure events increasing** - 5 multi-day breakdowns this week vs. 1 last week
- **Transport access limitations** - Underground repairs hampered by logistics
- **Repair completion rates declining** - Multiple incomplete jobs carrying over
- **Third-party system dependencies** - STRATA failures causing cascading issues

### Contract & Support Issues
- **NCH3 support contract lapsed** - Critical smart enablement systems unsupported
- **Project commissioning regressed** - Fewer machines completed than previous week
- **Training compliance stagnant** - CAS L9 certifications remain incomplete

## Week-over-Week Trending (Negative)
- **Equipment reliability**: **ðŸ“‰ SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION** - 400% increase in multi-day failures
- **Project progress**: **ðŸ“‰ REGRESSION** - Commissioning numbers decreased
- **Contract status**: **ðŸ“‰ CRITICAL** - Key support agreements expired
- **Parts availability**: **ðŸ“‰ WORSENING** - Policy conflicts creating delays

## Immediate Management Actions Required
1. **ðŸ”´ URGENT**: Renew NCH3 Certiq & Mobilaris support contract
2. **ðŸ”´ URGENT**: Resolve parts procurement policy with stores management
3. **ðŸ”´ HIGH**: Investigate BMS error patterns across fleet - potential systemic issue
4. **ðŸ”´ HIGH**: Expedite charger module replacements - infrastructure failing
5. **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM**: Review transport/access procedures for underground repairs
6. **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM**: Complete overdue CAS L9 training certifications

## Strategic Concerns for Executive Attention
- **Fleet reliability declining** - Trend indicates aging infrastructure without adequate maintenance
- **Support contract management** - Critical systems operating without vendor support
- **Parts and logistics coordination** - Internal policy conflicts hampering operations
- **Reactive vs. proactive maintenance** - Need strategic shift to prevent cascading failures
