# BRMO Weekly Report LIVE - Week 4 Summary (Aug 28 - Sep 3, 2025)

**Report Period**: August 28 - September 3, 2025  
**Submitted by**: Philip Moller (Epiroc)  
**Recipients**: [[Taku, Sello]], [[Dubazane, Sipho]]  
**Source**: PDF Report from Epiroc SA

## Executive Summary - CRITICAL DETERIORATION CONTINUES

**Week 4 Analysis**: This report documents the fourth consecutive week of systematic BEV fleet operational decline, with critical infrastructure failures now compounding machine reliability issues. The situation has escalated from isolated incidents to systemic operational breakdown requiring immediate senior management intervention.

### Critical Alert Status
🔴 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**
- **DT150**: 7 consecutive days down - tool shortage blocking repairs
- **Charging Infrastructure**: 4 charger modules failed/offline
- **Contract Lapses**: Multiple support contracts expired/terminated

## Critical Issues Summary

### 🚨 Priority 1 - Immediate Intervention Required

#### DT150 Extended Breakdown
- **Duration**: 7 consecutive days (Aug 28 - Sep 3)
- **Root Cause**: Missing specialized tools for suspension cylinder nut tightening
- **Impact**: 100% machine unavailability for extended period
- **Action Required**: Emergency tool procurement/sourcing

#### Charging Infrastructure Crisis
- **Charger 4**: Module 1 removed (faulty, needs replacement)
- **Charger 5**: Module 4 removed (faulty, needs replacement)  
- **Charger 7**: One module switched off (trips mini sub breaker)
- **Charger 8**: One module switched off (trips mini sub breaker)
- **CCS Connectors**: Posts 3, 6, and 7 cables require replacement

#### Contract Management Failures
- **Epiroc SLA**: 84% compliance - Contract stopped, pack to be archived
- **NCH3 Support Contract**: Expired - blocking S2 optimization project
- **Financial Impact**: Support interruptions during critical operational period

### 🟡 Priority 2 - Ongoing Operational Issues

#### Fleet Breakdown Pattern (Week 4)
**Daily Breakdown Summary:**
- **Thursday Aug 28**: FL107, FL108, FL112, DT149, DT150, DT162 affected
- **Friday Aug 29**: DT147, DT150 continued issues
- **Monday Sep 1**: FL112 aircon fault (3D07H48min downtime)
- **Tuesday Sep 2**: FL98, DT150, DT171 breakdowns
- **Wednesday Sep 3**: FL108, FL112, FL113, DT147, DT163, DT171 issues

#### Battery Status Concerns
- **ST14-B4**: 10 battery packs for 6 machines (meets 1.6 ratio)
- **VPY-00031**: Breakdown status - TMS replacement pending
- **MT42-B5**: 12 packs operational (above committed ratio)
- **Surface Issues**: VPX-00015 waiting to go underground

## Comparison to Previous Weeks

### Trend Analysis (4-Week Comparison)
| Metric | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Fleet Availability** | Stable | Declining | Critical | Emergency |
| **Breakdown Duration** | Hours | Days | Extended | Week+ |
| **Infrastructure Issues** | Minor | Moderate | Severe | Critical |
| **Contract Status** | Active | Warning | Lapsing | Terminated |

### Deterioration Pattern
1. **Week 1 (Aug 6-13)**: Baseline operational challenges
2. **Week 2 (Aug 14-20)**: Equipment reliability decline begins  
3. **Week 3 (Aug 21-27)**: Multiple critical failures emerge
4. **Week 4 (Aug 28-Sep 3)**: **SYSTEMATIC BREAKDOWN** - infrastructure + fleet + contracts

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause Categories
1. **Resource Management**: Tool shortages preventing repairs (DT150)
2. **Infrastructure Aging**: Multiple charger module failures
3. **Maintenance Backlog**: Extended repair times increasing
4. **Contract Management**: Support coverage gaps developing

### Operational Impact Assessment
- **Production Capacity**: Significantly reduced due to extended machine downtime
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Severely compromised by resource constraints  
- **Fleet Reliability**: Systematic decline across all machine categories
- **Support Coverage**: Critical gaps due to contract lapses

## Immediate Action Requirements

### Emergency Interventions (48 Hours)
1. **DT150 Tool Procurement**: Emergency sourcing of suspension cylinder tools
2. **Charger Module Replacement**: Expedite faulty module repairs/replacement
3. **Contract Reactivation**: Restore NCH3 support contract urgently

### Short-term Actions (1-2 Weeks)
1. **Infrastructure Audit**: Comprehensive charger and CCS connector assessment
2. **Tool Inventory Review**: Prevent future tool shortage incidents
3. **Maintenance Resource Allocation**: Increase technician availability

### Strategic Actions (1 Month)
1. **BEV Fleet Sustainability Review**: Comprehensive operational model assessment
2. **Contract Management Overhaul**: Prevent future support gaps
3. **Alternative Technology Evaluation**: Consider operational alternatives

## Recommendations

### Senior Management Actions Required
1. **Emergency Meeting**: BEV operations crisis response team formation
2. **Resource Authorization**: Emergency budget approval for critical repairs
3. **Vendor Engagement**: Direct escalation with Epiroc leadership
4. **Operational Review**: Fundamental BEV strategy reassessment

### Technical Recommendations
1. **Maintenance Strategy**: Transition to predictive maintenance model
2. **Spare Parts Management**: Critical spares inventory expansion
3. **Tool Management**: Comprehensive tool tracking and availability system
4. **Infrastructure Redundancy**: Charger backup systems implementation
