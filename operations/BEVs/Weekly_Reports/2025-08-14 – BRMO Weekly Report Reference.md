4. **Contract status** - NCH3 support contract lapsed

### Persistent Issues
1. **DT109** - Gear issues remain unresolved (2+ weeks)
2. **Charger infrastructure** - No progress on module/fan replacements
3. **Training compliance** - CAS L9 training still incomplete

### New Concerns
1. **BMS error patterns** - Suggesting systemic battery management issues
2. **Transport limitations** - Affecting repair response times
3. **Parts procurement policies** - Creating unnecessary delays

## Planned Work (Coming Week)
- **DC/DC campaign onboarding** - Artisan preparation continues
