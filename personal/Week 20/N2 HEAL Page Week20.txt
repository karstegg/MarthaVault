HIGHLIGHTS
----------
• Recognition of Nch2's safety performance at Assmang SHE awards

EMERGING ISSUES
---------------
• We struggled in completing job cards due to upgrades/ changes on Appshare. Matter has been escalated to chief planner for assistance

ACTIONS
-------
• CAS L9 installations
• Commission new dump truck DT181
• There is an issue of a Mechanic which needs to be resolved (he went to EAP and did not get the outcome he wanted, and then went to report his issue to the Union. Union went straight to HR Manager)

LOWLIGHTS

• MTC – employee slipped and fell while descending staircase from Mechanics workshop tearoom
• Production performance (12 708t below target)
• Planned work of dam cleaning was cancelled due to method statement not addressing all the risks
