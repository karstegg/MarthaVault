# MarthaVault Intuition Layer - Project Charter

## Project Overview
**Status**: Graduated from IDEAS/ to active project development
**Goal**: Implement adaptive learning AI assistant with persistent memory and behavioral intelligence

## Problem Statement
Current Claude interactions require lengthy context each time, lack memory of past decisions, and cannot learn from user patterns. Need an "intuitive" AI assistant that understands domain context, recognizes recurring patterns, and executes proven solutions quickly while maintaining source-grounded accuracy.

## Vision
An AI assistant that feels "intuitive" - understanding Greg's work patterns, domain expertise, and strategic priorities across months/years of interaction. The system should get smarter over time, requiring fewer edits and providing increasingly relevant responses.

## Source Documentation
**Originated from IDEAS folder:**
- [[2025-09-10 – MarthaVault Intuition Layer Enhancement Framework]] - Technical PRD
- [[2025-09-10 – MarthaVault Intuition Layer Analysis]] - Strategic analysis  
- [[../../../IDEAS/2025-09-07 – Self-Evolving Agents Research for Intuition Layer]] - Research foundation

## Core Components
1. **Smart Memory Layer** - MCP-based persistent memory with semantic search
2. **Obsidian Watcher Plugin** - Real-time vault indexing and metadata extraction
3. **Behavioral Intelligence Stack** - Reflex cache, skills library, policy memory
4. **Strategy Integration** - Company/department strategy as first-class priority multipliers
5. **Sub-Agent Architecture** - Specialized Claude.md contexts for domain expertise
6. **Learning System** - Continuous improvement from user feedback patterns

## Key Principles
- **Zero Disruption**: Preserve all existing workflows and vault organization
- **Source Grounded**: 100% citation requirements, no AI hallucination
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Add capabilities progressively without breaking existing patterns
- **Strategic Alignment**: Bias toward company/department strategic objectives
- **Obsidian Native**: Plugin-based approach, no external daemon processes

## Success Metrics
- **Speed**: Median response time <3s for common workflows
- **Quality**: >85% acceptance rate for auto-executed reflexes
- **Learning**: Measurable confidence improvements over 30 days
- **Strategic Alignment**: >70% high-priority actions linked to active objectives
- **Workflow Preservation**: 100% compatibility with existing commands

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 0**: Foundation analysis and migration planning
2. **Phase 1**: MVP foundation with strategy layer
3. **Phase 2**: Obsidian plugin development  
4. **Phase 3**: Behavioral intelligence and learning
5. **Phase 4**: Advanced integration and testing
6. **Phase 5**: Production deployment and optimization

## Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback Strategy**: Git-based versioning for easy reversion
- **Fallback Path**: Always available deliberate mode when reflexes fail
- **Conservative Thresholds**: Start with high confidence requirements
- **User Control**: Manual override capabilities for all automated actions

## Next Steps
1. Complete comprehensive implementation plan
2. Share draft with GPT-5 for technical review
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Begin Phase 0 implementation

## Project Team
- **Lead**: Greg (architecture, requirements, testing)
- **Technical Advisor**: GPT-5 (implementation strategy, technical review)
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Code (development execution, documentation)

## Timeline
**Target Start**: After GPT-5 review and plan approval
**MVP Target**: 6 weeks from project start
**Full Implementation**: 8-10 weeks including optimization
