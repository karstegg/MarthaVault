# GPT-5 Feedback Log - MarthaVault Intuition Layer

## Review Request Status
**Status**: Pending GPT-5 Review  
**Submitted**: TBD  
**Documents for Review**:
- [[2025-09-11 – Project Charter]]
- [[2025-09-11 – Implementation Plan Draft v1]]
- [[docs/alignment_analysis]]

## Feedback Rounds

### Round 1: Initial Technical Review
**Date**: TBD  
**Focus**: Technical architecture validation and implementation strategy

#### Key Questions for GPT-5
1. **Architecture Validation**
   - Is the MCP sidecar approach optimal for this use case?
   - Are the API contracts well-designed for future scalability?
   - Does the behavioral stack (reflex/skills/policy/gatekeeper) make sense?

2. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Is the 6-phase rollout realistic and well-sequenced?
   - Are the confidence thresholds (≥0.80, 0.60-0.79, <0.60) appropriate?
   - Does the zero-disruption approach adequately protect existing workflows?

3. **Strategic Integration**
   - Is the priority multiplication formula sound?
   - Will the sub-agent architecture provide meaningful domain expertise?
   - Are the success metrics measurable and achievable?

4. **Risk Mitigation**
   - What technical risks are we missing?
   - Are the fallback mechanisms sufficient?
   - How can we better ensure source-grounded integrity?

## Notes for GPT-5 Review

### Context Provided
- Complete vault analysis from existing MarthaVault structure
- Detailed technical framework from IDEAS/2025-09-10 documents
- Strategic alignment with mining engineering domain requirements
- Integration with existing MCP infrastructure (WhatsApp, memory systems)

### Specific Technical Concerns
1. **Obsidian Plugin Complexity**: Balancing real-time monitoring with performance
2. **Confidence Calibration**: How to tune thresholds for optimal user experience
3. **Sub-Agent Coordination**: Ensuring seamless handoffs between specialized contexts
4. **Learning System Safety**: Preventing drift or degradation in AI behavior

### Success Criteria for Review
- Technical architecture validated as sound and scalable
- Implementation timeline confirmed as realistic
- Risk mitigation strategies deemed adequate
- Strategic value proposition confirmed
