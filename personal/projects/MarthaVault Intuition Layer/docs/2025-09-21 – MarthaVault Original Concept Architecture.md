# MarthaVault Original Concept & Architecture

## Document Reference
**Source**: [[media/documents/2025/2025-09-21_MarthaVault_Original_Concept_Architecture.pdf]]
**Date Processed**: 2025-09-21
**Type**: Foundational architecture documentation

## Overview
This document contains the original concept and architectural design for MarthaVault, providing foundational understanding of the system's intended structure and evolution.

## Key Architectural Concepts

### Original Vision (September 2025)
The original concept was for creating an **AI assistant that can work with me to handle the complexities of my daily organization** with the power of AI like Gemini or Claude.

**Core Principle**: An AI agent that will replace my daily and weekly habits/tasks. Instead of me being a Senior Engineer, this AI agent becomes the "Senior Engineer Assistant."

### System Requirements & Components

#### A) Input Management to AI Agent
- **Voice notes**
- **Text notes**
- **Image/pictures**
- **Documents (PDFs)**

#### B) Daily Planning & Review Capabilities
- Daily start/end of day review & plan with priorities
- Weekly/Monthly planning/priorities

#### C) Integration & Scheduling
- **Help with planning and prioritizing**

#### D) Core Methods & Processes
- **Share my methods and achieve corporate results**
- **Have multiple organisational contexts**

### Key Infrastructure Requirements

#### Equipment & Technology Stack
- **Key departments**: Equipment, Members, Maintenance, History, Fire & breakdowns
- **Safety**: Incidents, Reports, Standards, Risk Assessments
- **Projects**: Capital, Progress tracking

#### Content Management
- **Triage by workflow**: Inbox → Triage by workflow → Key information
- **Context management**: Organised, trackable, etc.

### Second Brain Concept
**Field visit inspections** → notes/pictures → **Inbox** → **Meetings** → Key decisions/Actions → **Action Tracker** including assigned work to subordinates

### Daily Planning/Review Process
- On a daily basis: review inbox and update task list and plan/priorities
- Monitoring on weekly and monthly basis

### AI Assistant Integration
At the end of the day: want an AI assistant that understands my way of working within my Company context.

### Platform Requirements
Must work with number of options:
1) **ChatGPT + Projects**
2) **Gemini + Google Cloud** to keep track of all items/tasks/places
3) **Obsidian + ?**

Final decision: **Obsidian + Cloud Code** - a very flexible solution based on text/markdown system. Cloud Code can do triage and maintain everything.

## Connection to Current Evolution
This original concept document provides historical context for the current MarthaVault evolution, particularly relevant to:

- [[2025-09-11 – MarthaVault Evolution and Intuition Layer Thoughts]]
- [[IDEAS/Martha Design n Evolution/Sr Engineer Assistant System (Martha).md]]
- [[IDEAS/Martha Design n Evolution/Original Martha Architecture Diagram.md]]
- [[IDEAS/Martha Design n Evolution/Original Martha Sequence Diagram.md]]

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Flow Diagram (from original notes)
The system follows this workflow:
```
Input Sources → Inbox → Triage by workflow → Context organization
- Voice notes      ↓           ↓                    ↓
- PDFs            Inbox → Key Information → Daily tracking
- Meeting notes    ↓           ↓                    ↓
- Inspections     What must happen next? → Projects/tags/etc.
```

### Current Status vs Original Vision
- **Achieved**: Obsidian + Claude Code integration ✓
- **Achieved**: Text/markdown based system ✓
- **Achieved**: Triage workflow automation ✓
- **In Progress**: Full "Senior Engineer Assistant" capabilities
- **Planned**: Enhanced AI context understanding

### Key Success Metrics
1. Daily inbox processing and task list updates
2. Weekly/monthly review cycles maintained
3. Corporate context integration
4. Subordinate work tracking and assignment
