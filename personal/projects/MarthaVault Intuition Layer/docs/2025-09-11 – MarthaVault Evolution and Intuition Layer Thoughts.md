# 2025-09-11 – MarthaVault Evolution and Intuition Layer Thoughts

## Business Understanding Requirements
Martha must also understand the business. How it works, mining and production process, mining cycle, key business processes, key people, key stakeholders, production plan, business plan, strategic plans.

My key subordinates, projects, activities, tasks,

Martha must understand the context so she can provide good support for planning and prioritization.

## Intuition Layer Framework Considerations
I cant help but think about the intuition layer scaffold / framework and the parallels with Obsidian with links and backlinks, graph view with basic and graph memory mcp. Do we need to then add these MCP servers? Can we not build on what's already there in obsidian?

## Memory Layer Questions
Why do we need a memory layer when we can just update the Claude memory / context (claude.md file) as and when needed. Also using subagents with focused context?

## Action Items
- [ ] Generate a list of things that the assistant can do

## Vision
Companion, takes in context all day everyday grows in understanding
