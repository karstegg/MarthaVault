# Double-Mindedness - James 1:5-8

**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Source**: Morning devotion  
**Scripture**: James 1:5-8 (MSG)

## Scripture Text

> [5-8] If you don't know what you're doing, pray to the Father. He loves to help. You'll get his help, and won't be condescended to when you ask for it. Ask boldly, believingly, without a second thought. People who "worry their prayers" are like wind-whipped waves. Don't think you're going to get anything from the Master that way, adrift at sea, keeping all your options open.

**Reference**: https://bible.com/bible/97/jas.1.5-8.MSG

## Personal Reflection

The Message translation particularly struck a chord with the imagery of being "adrift at sea, keeping all your options open." This powerful metaphor describes double-mindedness as being like wind-whipped waves - unstable and directionless.

## Key Insights

- **Bold Faith**: Ask boldly and believingly without second-guessing
- **God's Character**: He loves to help and won't condescend when we ask
- **Double-Mindedness Warning**: "Worrying prayers" lead to instability
- **Vivid Imagery**: Being adrift at sea while keeping all options open

## Application

The call is to move from hesitation and keeping multiple options open to bold, believing prayer with clear direction and trust in God's guidance.
