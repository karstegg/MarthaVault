# 2025-09-20 – Personal Reflection

This is our promised land!
But you have to lay hold of it.
The problem is that You don't have faith in yourself, But
God will use you despite you!
Its not about You!
But I co not want to be in a Situation where I am the fool!
I am being paid to do a job!

Remember in the shower. You were prepared for Such a time as this.
