2. **Derek** (Nchw 3 TMM) - Minor gaps in mechanical/drillshop operations

### Engineering Roles Without GES Oversight
⚠️ **Critical Gap**: Engineering positions lacking GES supervision showing poor performance:
- Nchw 3 Engineer: 75.86%
- Black Rock Engineer Services & Planning: 96.55%

## Critical Action Items

### **URGENT** (Immediate Action Required)
- [ ] **[[Sipho Dubazane]]**: Meet with GES Stef regarding BEV operations (76.56%)
- [ ] **[[Sipho Dubazane]]**: Direct engineering oversight - investigate 75.86% compliance
- [ ] **[[Masigcinane Mteki]]**: Review Services & Planning engineer performance (96.55%)
- [ ] **GES Structure Review**: Consider GES oversight for engineering positions

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (This Week)
- [ ] **GES Stef**: BEV maintenance protocol review and training plan
- [ ] **GES Derek**: Mechanical (98.60%) and Drillshop (99.10%) improvement plan
- [ ] **Best Practice Transfer**: Arrange knowledge sharing from high-performing GES

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (This Month)
- [ ] **Quarterly GES Reviews**: Implement regular performance monitoring
- [ ] **GES Training**: Battery Electric Vehicle maintenance protocols
- [ ] **Supervision Model Review**: Evaluate GES coverage gaps
