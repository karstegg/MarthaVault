## Critical Action Items

### **URGENT** (Immediate Action Required)
- [ ] **[[Dubazane, Sipho]]**: Meet with GES Stef regarding BEV operations (76.56%)
- [ ] **[[Dubazane, Sipho]]**: Direct engineering oversight - investigate 75.86% compliance
- [ ] **[[Masigcinane Mteki]]**: Review Services & Planning engineer performance (96.55%)
- [ ] **GES Structure Review**: Consider GES oversight for engineering positions

### **HIGH PRIORITY** (This Week)
- [ ] **GES Stef**: BEV maintenance protocol review and training plan
- [ ] **GES Derek**: Mechanical (98.60%) and Drillshop (99.10%) improvement plan
- [ ] **Best Practice Transfer**: Arrange knowledge sharing from high-performing GES

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (This Month)
- [ ] **Quarterly GES Reviews**: Implement regular performance monitoring
- [ ] **GES Training**: Battery Electric Vehicle maintenance protocols
