Good day

Regarding the mobile chargers – objective is to move the chargers as close to working place as possible to eliminate travel to B/Bay for midshift battery change. Also enable charging after nightshift, freeing up 4 posts at B/Bay

We will move both chargers to the following areas:
* 70N4E (Main west new waiting place)
* 60N52E (Central)

Next steps:
* Determine power supply capacity (Stef/Sello) – Tue
* Draft procedure (Jabu) – Mon
* Enable 2 machines to be charged at end of shift at each charger (Piet, additional cables to be installed if required)

Regards,
Greg Karsten
