# Conveyor Belt Technical Reference Library

**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Purpose**: Centralized reference library for conveyor belt design, safety, operation, and maintenance

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive technical documentation for conveyor belt systems used across Black Rock operations (Nchwaning 2, Nchwaning 3, Gloria). These resources support:

- Equipment specification and procurement
- Safety compliance and risk assessment
- Maintenance planning and troubleshooting
- Incident investigation (e.g., belt failures, safety incidents)
- Training and competency development
