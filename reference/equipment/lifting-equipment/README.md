## Critical Safety Reminders

⚠️ **STOP WORK AUTHORITY**: Any person can stop a lift if unsafe conditions exist
⚠️ **NEVER exceed Safe Working Load (SWL)** of equipment or accessories

⚠️ **NEVER man-ride without proper man-riding certification** and equipment
⚠️ **REPORT defects immediately** - withdraw defective equipment from service

## Notes

- **Lifting operations are HIGH-RISK activities** - strict adherence to procedures is non-negotiable
- These documents form part of the **Legal Appointments Register** (Managing Mine Safety)
- Non-compliance can result in **Section 54 stoppages** by DMRE inspectors
- Annual budget required for lifting equipment certification (~R150k-200k/year across all sites)
