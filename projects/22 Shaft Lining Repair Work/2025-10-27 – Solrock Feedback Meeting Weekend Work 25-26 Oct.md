## Year-End Shutdown Planning Discussion

**Issue**: Solrock operations only run on weekends - need clarity on year-end shutdown scheduling

**Shutdown Period**: 13 December 2025 - 4 January 2026

**Question for Rudi**:
How can we schedule Solrock work during the year-end shutdown period?
- Weekdays available during shutdown?
- Continue weekend-only operations?
- Alternative scheduling?

**Action**: Email sent to Rudi Opperman (CC: Jacques Breet, Xavier Petersen, Roelie Prinsloo) requesting guidance on year-end scheduling
