# Bearing Temperature Monitoring Capital Project

## Project Overview

**Project Type**: Belt Temperature Monitoring Expansion
**Category**: Unplanned Capital Application (Pending)
**Vendor**: Supreme Marketing (theunis@suprememarketing.co.za)
**Priority Level**: Medium

## Scope

Expansion of bearing temperature monitoring systems for conveyor belt infrastructure across N2, N3, and S&W sites. DMPR regulatory requirement for real-time bearing temperature monitoring.

## Key Documents

- **Capital Estimate**: `Bearing Temp Monitoring Capital Estimate.xlsx`
- **Supplier Quotations**:
  - QU101520 - Budget Quote
  - QU101521 - Remote Prognosis Quote
- **Technical Documentation**: `Folder_2024 digital En.pdf`

## Final Estimate & Status

**Estimate sent:** 2025-11-19 16:07 SAST to Ilze Malouly (with team cc'd)

**Updated estimate breakdown:**
- **N2 (Nchwaning 2):** R5.3M
- **N3 (Nchwaning 3):** R3.3M  
- **Gloria:** R950k
- **Total:** R9.55M

**Estimate file:** `Beraring Temp monitoring capital estimate.xlsx` (attached to email)

**Context:** SK (Sikelela Nzuza) added more belts after initial estimate - N2 Graben conveyors have 226 plumber blocks total (corrected from initial count of 192)

**Recipients:** Sikelela Nzuza, Jacques Breet, Ilze Malouly, Sipho Dubazane, Stef Lourens, Sello Sease

**Current status:** Waiting for Ilze to add to unplanned capital register and obtain GM feedback on capital allocation

- System specs available from Stef Lourens
- Integration with Life Online system validated
- Next phase: Expand to N3 decline tail section (working cost)

**Implementation Plan:**
- Main capex scheduled for Years 2-4
- Sites must request capex to be brought forward
- Priority belt identification needed from site engineers
