## NEROSPEC (LDO - Cruiser/Loader Dozers)
**Lead:** Nico (Nerospec team lead)

### GLORIA SHAFT
**Units Planned This Week:** LDO 600, 602, 558, 562

#### Current Status
- **LDO 600** - 70% commissioned (⚠️ OVERCHARGING PROBLEM - alternator issue)
- **LDO 602** - Newly installed alternator causing breakdown:
  - Auxiliary battery not charging (fluctuating 3.5V-12V)
  - PDU clicking
  - Main battery overcharging (15.4V)
  - **REQUIRES TRANSERVE ASSISTANCE**
- **LDO 558** - Planned for commissioning
- **LDO 562** - Planned for commissioning
- **Alternators** - Arrived at site

#### Key Blocker
⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUE:** Alternator installation causing charging/battery problems on LDO 600 & 602. Transerve required for diagnosis.

### NCH2 (Nchwaning 2)
- **LD 593** - Commissioned (not originally planned but arranged)

### NCH3 (Nchwaning 3)
- **LD 573** - Ready for commissioning BUT **park brake not releasing** (blocking progress)
- **LD 614** - Alternator replacement in progress
- **Operator Issue:** No dedicated operator currently assigned to L9 Activation at NCH3

#### Key Blockers
- Park brake release failure on LD 573
- Operator availability at NCH3
- Nerospec team delayed on first day (medicals ran late, only arrived 12h00)

### Next Actions
- Need Transerve support for alternator/battery diagnostics
- Park brake repair needed for LD 573
- Operator assignment needed at NCH3
- Nerospec meeting requested to discuss alternator technical difficulties

## AARD (UVs - Underground Vehicles)
**Lead:** Sibonele / Auto electrician

### Current Progress
- **UV 136** - ✅ Tested and signed off (Level 9 COC)
- **UV 110** - Speed sensors installed, testing outstanding, proxy switch installation pending
- **UV 105** - ⚠️ **REMOVED FROM SCHEDULE** - Panel needs replacement, machine requires rewiring
- **UV 128** - Emulsion unit (priority after UV 110)
- **UV 67** - Planned for speed sensor install
- **UV 68** - Planned for speed sensor install
- **UV 129** - ✅ Tested and signed off

### Plan for Next Days (Nov 10-12)
1. Finish testing UV 110
2. Install speed sensors & harnesses on UV 67, 68 (if available)
3. Monday: Replace speed sensors/harnesses on UV 105, 110, 67, 68
4. Speed sensor/harness procurement: **Completed** - technician bringing supplies Monday

### Key Discoveries
- Speed sensors not recording on UV 105, 110, 67, 68 - needs sensor & harness replacement
- Brackets welded on UV 105, 110, 67, 68
- Access issues resolved (AARD team coordination sorted)
- CAN bus wiring issue resolved (ECS↔STRATA connection)

### Blockers
- UV 105 panel replacement (external work)
- Machine availability (e.g., UV 110 in use on arrival)
- Schedule pressure - emulsion machines (UV 67, 68) cannot run simultaneously

## ECS (Data Loggers/Software)
**Lead:** Wynand (Fermel team)

### Gloria Shaft Machines Completed
- **LDO 451** - Software ✅, Data logger ✅ (SN: 252627), COC pending, availability from Strata issue
- **LDO 429** - Software ✅, Data logger ✅ (SN: 252626), COC pending
- **LDO 516** - Software ✅, Data logger ✅ (SN: 253705), COC pending
- **LDO 423, 425** - Planned for completion
- **LDO 429** - Data logger + harness + programming planned

### Plan
- Marnus: Training Nov 10-12, returns Nov 13
- Continue with LDO 423, 425 data logger completion
- Harness fabrication (ECS making up)

## SUMMARY - Critical Path Items

### 🔴 BLOCKERS (Must Resolve)
1. **Alternator/Battery Issue** - LDO 600 & 602 charging problems → **NEEDS TRANSERVE**
2. **Park Brake** - LD 573 not releasing → **Scheduled repair**
3. **Operator Availability** - NCH3 L9 activation support → **Assigned Piet + daily underground support**
4. **UV 105 Panel** - Requires external panel replacement before work can continue

### 🟡 WATCH (Track Closely)
1. Nerospec stop/crawl configuration (CR0092)
2. Speed sensor testing (UV 110)
3. COC completion (multiple LDOs at Gloria)
4. Strata scheduling conflicts (machines in use)

### ✅ MOMENTUM (Good Progress)
1. Apprentice support now in place (2 per shaft)
2. Second Aard team operational
3. Additional Nerospec resources deployed
4. Strata booking system active (4 slots/day/shaft)
5. ECS software/data loggers 90% complete at Gloria

## WEEKEND WORK ALERT
Greg's note: "At the rate we're going we will have to start working weekends as well"
**Action:** Plan for weekend work starting this coming weekend - to be discussed in update meeting.

## Next Steps for L9 Meetings
1. Confirm Transerve availability for LDO 600/602 diagnostics
2. Review park brake repair timeline (LD 573)
3. Address operator gaps at NCH3
4. Track speed sensor installation progress (AARD)
5. Monitor Strata commissioning pace (target 4/day/shaft)
6. Coordinate weekend work schedule with all OEMs
