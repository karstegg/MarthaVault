**At a glance**

- **LMT** is marginally cheaper (≈ 6 %) but uses a larger team (1 + 3) focused on day-to-day maintenance and weekly reports; scope includes LED-light extensions but **excludes** network upgrades or malicious-damage spares.
    
- **PBE** charges more per month, fields a leaner team (1 + 2) and bundles forward moves, OEM auditing, formal training and an optional radio-hardware supply; labour and spares are itemised separately, giving clearer cost segregation.
