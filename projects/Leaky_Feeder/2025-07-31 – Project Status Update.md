# Leaky Feeder Project Status Update

**Contact**: [[Lizette]] (Procurement/Vendor Management)  
**Current Issue**: Vendor status complications  

## Current Situation
- Awaiting quotes from PPE (current preferred vendor)
- **Problem**: PPE is not currently an active vendor
- PPE was previously a vendor but needs to be reopened
- Reopening vendor status will require a formal process

## Alternative Options
- **Liquid Mist**: Alternative vendor option
- If Liquid Mist provides lowest quote, can proceed without reopening PPE vendor status
- Otherwise, formal vendor reopening process required for PPE

## Next Actions
- [ ] Review Liquid Mist quote upon receipt
- [ ] Compare quotes from all available vendors
- [ ] Decide between vendor reopening process or alternative vendor selection
- [ ] Coordinate with [[Lizette]] on procurement path forward

## Decision Criteria
- **Preferred**: Use lowest quote from active vendors
- **Secondary**: Initiate vendor reopening process for PPE if significantly better value
