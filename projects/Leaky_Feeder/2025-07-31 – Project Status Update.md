# Leaky Feeder Project Status Update

**Contact**: [[Lizette]] (Procurement/Vendor Management)  
**Current Issue**: Vendor status complications  

## Current Situation
- Awaiting quotes from PPE (current preferred vendor)
- **Problem**: PPE is not currently an active vendor
- PPE was previously a vendor but needs to be reopened
- Reopening vendor status will require a formal process

## Alternative Options
- **Liquid Mist**: Alternative vendor option
- If Liquid Mist provides lowest quote, can proceed without reopening PPE vendor status
- Otherwise, formal vendor reopening process required for PPE

## URGENT Next Actions (Due This Week)
- [ ] **PRIORITY**: Finalize vendor selection - PPE vs Liquid Mist vs other active vendors
- [ ] **URGENT**: Complete contract finalization and place order by Friday Aug 29
- [ ] Contact [[Lizette]] immediately to expedite procurement process
- [ ] If vendor reopening required, initiate emergency process
- [ ] Confirm delivery timeline to ensure project stays on track

## Updated Status (2025-08-27)
**ESCALATED TO HIGH PRIORITY** - Contract must be finalized and order placed by end of week.

## Decision Criteria
- **Preferred**: Use lowest quote from active vendors
- **Secondary**: Initiate vendor reopening process for PPE if significantly better value
