# CAS Level 9 DMRE Commitment & Implementation Plan

**Project Type**: Regulatory Compliance (DMRE Commitment)
**Presentation Date**: October 17, 2025 (Thursday)
**Commitment Deadline**: December 31, 2025
**Project Lead**: [[Hennie van Niekerk]] (CAS Projects Engineer)
**Engineering Manager**: [[Gregory Karsten]]
**Strategic Alignment**: [[strategy/ActivePhase.md#1-CAS-Level-9-Compliance-Program]]

---

## Executive Summary

On **October 17, 2025**, BRMO presented to the DMRE (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy) / DMPR (Principal Inspector of Mines) outlining the **CAS (Collision Prevention System) Level 9 implementation plan** for full fleet compliance by **year-end 2025**.

**CPS = Collision Prevention System**
**CAS = Collision Avoidance System**
**TMM = Trackless Mobile Machinery**

This is a **regulatory compliance commitment** under the **TMM Regulations** (Chapter 8, Section 8.10) requiring:
- **Effective collision prevention systems** on all high-risk Front Loaders (FL) and Drill/Tramming machines (DT)
- **CAS Level 9**: Auto-retard and auto-stop functionality (highest safety level)
- **Significant risk mitigation** for TMM-to-TMM and TMM-to-pedestrian collisions

**Priority**: This is the **#1 Q4 2025 strategic priority** (ObjectiveWeight: 2.5x - highest multiplier)

## DMRE Presentation Overview

**Presentation File**: [[00_Inbox/Presentation October 2025 R7.pptx]]
**Total Slides**: 48 slides
**Key Sections**:
1. Overview & Implementation Approach
2. Status Update (installation progress by site)
3. Risks & Challenges
4. The Way Forward

---

## Implementation Status (as of Oct 17, 2025)

### High-Risk FL and DT Fleet

**Nchwaning 2**: Near completion (details in presentation)
**Nchwaning 3**: Full fleet pending (including BEV fleet - critical path item)
**Gloria**: In progress (details in presentation)
**SOT (Surface)**: Bell Equipment fleet - compliance resolution pending

### Total Fleet Coverage

**Target**: All trackless mobile machines to have appropriate CAS level by Dec 31, 2025

**Risk-Based Scope**:
- **Level 9** (Auto-retard + Auto-stop): High-risk FL, DT, LHDs
- **Level 7/8** (Effective warning): Bolters, Drill Rigs (risk-assessed lower collision risk)

---

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Safe Roads
- Review and alignment with CAS Level 9 impact
- Traffic management flow and plan implementation
- High-risk area identification and controls
- **Traffic Management Plan 2.0**

### 2. Safe People
- Human behavior and technology acceptance training
- CAS & BEV operational safety protocols
- **Collision Prevention Ecosystem** approach

### 3. Safe Vehicles
- OEM installations (CAT, Bell, Epiroc, Strata)
- CAS hardware and software integration
- Testing and commissioning
- Fail-safe state verification

---

## Key Challenges & Risks

### OEM Resource Availability
- **CAT**: Installation capacity and scheduling
- **Bell Equipment**: SOT surface fleet clarification needed
- **Epiroc**: BEV fleet integration (N3 critical path)
- **Strata**: Installation coordination

### Site Access & Coordination
- Equipment availability windows for installations
- Production impact minimization
- Multiple sites (N2, N3, Gloria, SOT) simultaneous coordination
- Testing and commissioning time requirements

### Technical Complexity
- **Fail-to-safe states**: Initiator, process, end state, re-enablement
- **End state**: Safe park functionality
- **Interface variations**: OEM-specific, TMM type-specific
- **Standdown vs Motion Inhibit**: Command sequence standardization

### Resource Constraints
- **Hennie van Niekerk**: Single point of failure as CAS project lead
- **Site Engineers**: Limited capacity for CAS coordination alongside operational duties
- **Solution**: 2 x Junior Project Engineers recruitment (URGENT)

---

## Mitigation Strategy

### Junior Project Engineer Recruitment (URGENT)

**Role**: CAS Installation Coordinators
**Count**: 2 positions (2-year fixed term)
**Timeline**:
- Ad currently running (as of Oct 20, 2025)
- Interviews target: Week of October 28, 2025
- Start date: ASAP (Nov/Dec 2025 target)

**Responsibilities**:
1. Coordinate OEM access to vehicles at N2, N3, Gloria, SOT
2. Schedule installations with site engineers and OEM technicians
3. Track installation progress and report weekly
4. Facilitate testing and commissioning logistics
5. Work directly with Hennie van Niekerk and CAS project team
6. Ensure minimal production impact during installations

**Strategic Importance**: Critical for achieving Dec 31 deadline

---

## Weekly CAS Progress Reporting

**Cadence**: Weekly (starting week of Oct 20-25, 2025)

**Key Metrics**:
- Installations completed this week (by site, by OEM)
- OEM schedules and resource allocation
- Site access windows confirmed/utilized
- Testing and commissioning status
- Blockers and risks (escalation items)
- Forecast to Dec 31 deadline

**Reporting To**: Gregory Karsten (Engineering Manager), Sello Taku (Engineering Manager)

**OEMs**: CAT, Epiroc

### Nchwaning 3
**Site GES**: TBD (recruitment in progress)
**Focus**: **BEV fleet CAS L9 integration** (critical path item)
**OEMs**: Epiroc (BEV specialist)

### Gloria
**Site GES**: [[Sipho Dubazane]]
**Focus**: High-risk FL and DT fleet completion
**OEMs**: CAT, Bell

**OEMs**: Bell Equipment

---

## Critical Path Items

### Priority 1: BEV Fleet (Nchwaning 3)
- **Status**: PENDING (all BEV machines require CAS L9)
- **Blocker**: Epiroc resource availability and BEV-specific integration
- **Impact**: Largest single fleet segment, regulatory high-risk
- **Action**: Escalate with Epiroc, schedule ASAP

### Priority 2: Bell Equipment SOT Clarification
- **Status**: PENDING (standdown vs motion inhibit specification)
- **Blocker**: Technical clarification needed with Bell Equipment
- **Impact**: Surface fleet compliance
- **Action**: Hennie to resolve with Bell technical team

### Priority 3: OEM Scheduling Coordination
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS (weekly coordination meetings needed)
- **Action**: JPE recruitment to support scheduling logistics

## Regulatory Context

### TMM Regulations (Chapter 8, Section 8.10)

**Underground Mines (8.10.1)**:
"The employer must take reasonably practicable measures to ensure that pedestrians are prevented from being injured as a result of collisions between trackless mobile machines and pedestrians."

**Surface Mines (8.10.2)**:
"The employer must take reasonably practicable measures to ensure that persons are prevented from being injured as a result of collisions between diesel powered trackless mobile machines."

### Significant Risk Definition (SAMRASS)
- "Noteworthy, of considerable amount or considerable effect or considerable importance" (Oxford Dictionary)
- "Likelihood that occupational injury or harm to persons will occur" (MHSA Sec. 102)
- TMM collisions are classified as **Priority/Material Unwanted Events (PUE/MUE)**
- TMM-pedestrian collisions = **Fatal Risk** (zero tolerance)
