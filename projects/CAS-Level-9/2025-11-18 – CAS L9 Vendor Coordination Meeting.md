## Strategic Context

**CAS Level 9 DMRE Deadline**: December 31, 2025 (43 days remaining)

**Overall Status**:
- ✅ Nerospec: Good progress, adding supervision
- ⚠️ Fermel: CRITICAL - Zero COCs, very slow
- ✅ Manitou: Active, weekend work scheduled
- ✅ Aard: Coordination items, planning movements
- ⏸️ Bell: Testing solution, Hennie observing

**Key Risks**:
1. **Fermel extremely slow** - Zero COCs with 43 days to deadline
2. **Resource constraints** - Need additional Fermel support
3. **Coordination complexity** - Multiple vendors, weekend work, equipment movements
