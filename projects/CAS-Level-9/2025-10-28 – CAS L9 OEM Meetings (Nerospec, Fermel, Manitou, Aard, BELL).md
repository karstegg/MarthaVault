## CRITICAL ISSUE: Resource Bottleneck

**Problem**: Strata resources are a general bottleneck - insufficient capacity to support CAS L9 commissioning timeline across all sites.

**Impact**: Serious risk to December 31, 2025 DMRE commitment deadline

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Offsite Work**: Evaluate offsite area where CAS work can be performed and tested away from mine (reduces dependency on Strata site resources)
   - **Action Owner**: Johnny
   - **Timeline**: Urgent evaluation needed

2. **Night Shift Utilization**: Use night shift Strata technicians to assist with project

3. **Additional Resources**:
   - Nerospec proposal: 3 people for 3 months (Chris Katzke coordinating)
   - ECS team expansion: Need 3rd team (currently 2 teams) - discuss with Shawn
   - Fermel resources: Discuss with Lourens/Niresha

### Recommendations
- [ ] **Escalate Strata resource issue to senior management** #task #year/2025 #priority/critical 📅 2025-10-29
- [ ] **Create resource allocation plan across all OEMs** #task #year/2025 #priority/critical 📅 2025-11-03
- [ ] **Approve offsite work area for CAS installations/testing** #task #year/2025 #priority/high 📅 2025-11-05
