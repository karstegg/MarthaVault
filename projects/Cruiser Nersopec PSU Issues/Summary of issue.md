*   **Origin:** An internal communication from Hennie van Niekerk (dated August 13, 2025) regarding Landcruiser installations.
*   **Core Problem:** Significant downtime issues in Landcruisers and Nerospec systems due to power supply instability, specifically within the vehicles' charging systems.
*   **Current System Flaw:** The 80 Amp alternator and a 5-minute delay in charging the auxiliary battery (which powers add-on equipment) lead to voltage drops (as low as 8V) to critical systems, causing instability and failures.
*   **Observations:** Existing MiniAUPS units are helpful but don't fix the root cause; the current power balance is at its limit and requires an upgrade.
*   **Proposed Solutions:**
    1.  **Immediate Auxiliary Battery Charging:** Modify the charging system to activate via an oil pressure switch, allowing the auxiliary battery to charge immediately upon engine start, bypassing the 5-minute delay.
    2.  **Alternator Upgrade:** Replace the current 80 Amp alternators with 120 Amp alternators to provide sufficient charging capacity for all onboard systems.
*   **Expected Outcome:** These modifications are anticipated to significantly enhance the reliability of onboard systems and reduce fleet downtime.
