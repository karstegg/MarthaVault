# Cruiser Nersopec PSU Issues Notes

The person involved is Hennie van Niekerk.
Company is Nersopec.
In discussion with Hennie, they want to prioritize the modification to let these auxiliary batteries also start immediately when the engine starts. They will do this by taking the signal from the oil pressure switch (different from before). Previously, there was a time delay because they wanted to have the main battery charge up first fully to avoid starter problems. But the result was that your auxiliary battery, which powers your interlocks (safety interlocks), would not in some cases charge, and then you won't start anyway because the interlocks are not working. Now it must start charging immediately. The company or the primary company is actually Transerve. They did the modification on the vehicles to install all these additional features which necessitated additional battery. They do our Cruiser conversion from a normal Cruiser to a mine-spec Cruiser. They will contract in Nersopec to do the modifications to the battery charging circuit. They also want to upgrade the alternators (currently they have 80A alternators) to 120A alternators because we think that the current alternators are not capable of supplying or charging both batteries sufficiently given the amount of load that's put on it.
