## 📝 Notes for Jacques Review

1. **Sipho's Early Completion**: Gloria capital project completed 6 weeks early - exceptional execution. Consider as best practice model for other sites.

2. **Delivery Expectations**: Confirmed that DT units have faster-than-normal delivery (weeks vs 18 months) - likely due to bundle pricing and expedited processing.

3. **Capital Coordination**: Jacques actively tracking across all sites. Monthly progress reviews are critical for maintaining schedule.

4. **Overdue Items**: Sello's N3 infrastructure presentation and equipment specs are blocking downstream tasks - need urgent follow-up.
