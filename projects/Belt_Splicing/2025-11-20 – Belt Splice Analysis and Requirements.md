**Document Source:** Conveyor Belt Splicing Scope from Fanele Mpofana (Khumani Mine)
**Initiated by:** Jacques Breet, Nov 20, 2025

## Summary
Multi-site conveyor belt splicing contract scope definition for N2, N3, Gloria, and S&W. Based on Khumani template - requires verification of actual belt configurations at BRMO sites.

## Information Required from Site Engineers

### 1. Conveyor Belt Inventory
- Fabric Belts (Plylon): widths 600-1800mm, classes 630-2000
- Steel Cord Belts: widths 1050-1800mm, classes 1600-2500
- Lab/Small Belts: 400-450mm

### 2. Pulley Lagging Inventory
- Standard Rubber Lagging
- Embedded Ceramic Lagging (drive applications only)

### 3. Conveyor Rolling Element Maintenance
- Idler roller/frame/bracket replacement frequency

### 4. Standby Team Requirements
- 24/7 availability needs per site
