## Summary

This is a **Khumani Iron Ore Mine contract** for conveyor belt splicing services. The document lists ALL possible conveyor belt types and pulley lagging configurations at Khumani. To update the scope for tender, we need to verify **current active conveyors and pulleys at each Assmang site** (N2, N3, Gloria, Shafts & Winders).

### 2. **PULLEY LAGGING INVENTORY**

**Drive, Head, and Tail Pulleys** - For each site, confirm quantities:

#### Standard Rubber Lagging
- **Small pulleys** (up to 900mm face width): Grip 60 x 10mm
- **Large pulleys** (wider than 900mm): Grip 70 x 12mm

Shell Diameter options: 400, 500, 630, 800, 1000, 1250 mm
Face Width options: 700, 900, 1050, 1200, 1350, 1500, 1700, 2000 mm

#### Embedded Ceramic Lagging
- **Type:** Nilos strip lagging, 12mm thick, 4-piece diamond pattern
- **Only on drive applications** (NOT tail/head)
- **Shell Diameter**: 400, 500, 630, 800, 1000, 1250 mm
- **Face Width**: 700, 900, 1050, 1200, 1350, 1500, 1700, 2000 mm

**Format needed:**
```
Site: [N2/N3/Gloria/S&W]
Conveyor Name: [e.g., CV10, CV220]
Pulley Position: [Drive / Head / Tail]
Lagging Type: [Standard Rubber / Ceramic]
Shell Diameter (mm): [actual]
Face Width (mm): [actual]
Quantity: [number of this pulley configuration]
```

### 3. **CONVEYOR ROLLING ELEMENT MAINTENANCE**

Confirm if site has:
- Idler roller replacement needs
- Idler frame replacements
- Idler bracket replacements

**Current frequency of maintenance?** (5 days per week is proposed in scope)

---

### 4. **CONVEYOR LIFE EXPECTANCY AUDITS**

Confirm requirements:
- Quarterly audits needed?
- Steel cord scanning needed?
- Inspection of conveyor rolls in stores?

---

### 5. **STANDBY TEAM REQUIREMENTS**

Which sites need 24/7 standby crews?
- **Parsons Mine**: Standby crew for Load-out, King, Bruce
- **Load-out**: Separate standby crew
- **King & Bruce**: Combined standby crew

**For each site, confirm:**
- 24/7 availability needed?
- Max reaction time: +/- 2 hours from call-out

## Critical Notes

1. **Belt types at Khumani** (referenced in document as examples):
   - Bruce CV10 – 1050mm Steel Cord Class 2500
   - King CV220 – 1350 ST 1250 Plylon
   - Off Grade CV250 Yard – 1200 ST1600
   - CV85 Off Grade Feed – 1800 Steel Cord 2000
   - CV40 Off-Grade Yard – 1200-1600
   - Lab belts: 400/450mm x 2 ply

2. **These may NOT be the same as at our sites** (N2, N3, Gloria, S&W) — need to verify current inventory

3. **Scope consolidation needed:**
   - Fanele's document is Khumani-specific
   - Need to create BRMO (multi-site) consolidated scope
   - Remove unnecessary belt/pulley configurations
   - Include only what we actually have at our sites

---

## Next Steps

1. **Request detailed conveyor belt inventory** from:
   - Sipho Dubazane (Gloria)
   - Sikelela Nzuza (N3)
   - Sello Sease (N2)
   - Xavier Peterson (Shafts & Winders)

2. **Request pulley lagging inventory** from same engineers

3. **Consolidate** all site data into single BRMO scope document

4. **Compare** with Khumani template to remove/add configurations

5. **Prepare tender** based on consolidated scope
