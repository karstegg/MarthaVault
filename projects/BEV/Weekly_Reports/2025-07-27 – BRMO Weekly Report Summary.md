**Report Source**: [[2025-07-27_BRMO_Weekly_Report_Epiroc.pdf]]  
**Submitted by**: Philip Moller (Epiroc SA)  
**Submitted to**: [[Sello Taku]] and [[Sipho Dubazane]]  
**Report Period**: July 21-27, 2025  

## Executive Summary
Critical performance issues identified with BEV fleet, particularly bucket conditions affecting FL machines and charger infrastructure problems. Overall availability trending at 98% weekly but systemic issues require immediate attention.

## üî¥ Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### ST14 Bucket Crisis
- **FL107**: Locked out entire week due to severely damaged bucket (corner missing, heavy cracks)
- **FL99**: Down 3+ days for bucket replacement (3D09H25min Friday)
- **FL98**: Extended downtime for bucket repairs at boilers (8H30min Wednesday)
- **Root Cause**: Buckets in poor condition across ST14 fleet

### Charger Infrastructure Failures
- **Charger 7**: Module 4 fault requiring replacement
- **Charger 1**: Faulty fan replacement needed
- **Chargers 2, 5, 7**: Each missing 1 module 
- **Multiple charger stops**: Worn charger and CCS battery inlet connectors

### Battery Performance Issues
- **VPX-00006 (MT42-B5)**: Down 6 days due to overheating - fault finding in progress
- Battery damage audits completed, quotations sent to BRMO for repairs
