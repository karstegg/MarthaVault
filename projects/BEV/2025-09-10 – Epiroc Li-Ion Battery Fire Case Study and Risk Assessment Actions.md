# Epiroc Li-Ion Battery Fire Case Study and Risk Assessment Actions - September 10, 2025

**Source Document**: `media/documents/2025/2025-09-10_Epiroc_Li-Ion_Battery_Fire_Case_Study.pdf`

## Executive Summary

Epiroc Li-Ion Battery Fire Report from January 31, 2025 incident at South African underground mining operation. Battery experienced thermal runaway during maintenance downtime, resulting in complete cell destruction. No injuries reported, but significant lessons learned for BEV operations.

**Key Finding**: Fire caused by improper storage/handling practices, water ingress, and inadequate staff training on Li-Ion battery safety protocols.

## Incident Overview

- **Date**: January 31, 2025 (00:12)
- **Location**: Underground mining operation, South Africa
- **Equipment**: Li-Ion battery pack (not in use, booked down for repairs)
- **Response**: 25-minute water dousing, mine evacuation, operations resumed same shift
- **Outcome**: Total battery loss, no injuries

## Critical Findings

### Storage & Handling Failures
- Battery cover and Thermal Management System (TMS) removed during storage
- Foreign objects found in battery casing (blasting caps, aluminum cans, masks, gloves)
- Improper storage location near other equipment
- Drainage valves not opened, allowing water accumulation
- IP rating compromised due to exposed conditions

### Safety Protocol Failures  
- Main Service Disconnect (MSD) left in ON position despite breakdown status
- Storage area not sectioned off or secured
- Inadequate lockout/tagout procedures during maintenance

### Training & Knowledge Gaps
- OEM training and recommendations not cascaded throughout organization
- Personnel handling batteries lacked proper Li-Ion safety knowledge
- No established escalation procedures for dangerous situations

## Water Ingress Analysis

Investigation revealed burn patterns consistent with water ingress into battery cavity. Areas below water level showed no fire damage, confirming water was present during thermal runaway event.

## Epiroc Recommendations

### 1. Storage & Handling
- Incorporate all OEM storage/handling conditions into Mine Risk Assessment & Procedures
- Ensure personnel awareness of proper storage and handling conditions
- Designate appropriate battery storage areas meeting OEM specifications
- Use correct tools for lifting and moving battery packs

### 2. Safe Operating Procedures
- Lock out any battery pack on breakdown to prevent accidental use
- Never leave battery packs open in underground environment
- Ensure all plug covers in place when battery pack is standalone
- Properly section off storage areas

### 3. Li-Ion Battery Knowledge & Training
- Educate organization on Li-Ion battery and dangerous goods risks
- Collaborate with Mine Rescue Services (MRS) on Li-Ion battery fire response
- Establish escalation procedures for dangerous situations
- Cascade OEM training to all personnel in contact with batteries

## BRMO Implementation Actions Required

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Review current BEV storage procedures** against Epiroc recommendations
2. **Audit BEV storage areas** for compliance with OEM specifications  
3. **Implement enhanced lockout/tagout** procedures for BEV maintenance
4. **Coordinate with Mine Rescue Services** on Li-Ion fire response protocols

### Short-term Actions (High Priority)
1. **Update BEV Fire Risk Assessment** incorporating Epiroc findings
2. **Enhance staff training program** on Li-Ion battery safety
3. **Review and update storage area designation** and security protocols
4. **Implement proper drainage procedures** for BEV storage areas

### Medium-term Actions (Medium Priority)  
1. **Develop comprehensive Li-Ion battery handling procedures**
2. **Create escalation procedures** for BEV-related dangerous situations
3. **Regular audits** of BEV storage and handling compliance
4. **Cross-reference with other industry incidents** for continuous improvement
