# Capital Application: Nchwaning 3 BEV Charging Bay 2

**Project Title**: N3 BEV CHARGING BAY 2
**Project Leader**: [[Gregory Karsten]]
**Application Date**: 2024-11-13
**Project Value**: R 106,153,799.00
**Project Start Date**: February 2025
**Project End Date**: June 2026

## Executive Summary

This capital application seeks funding to construct and equip a second underground battery charging bay at Nchwaning 3. This new bay will service the second fleet of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). The design incorporates key learnings from the first charging bay, which was successfully commissioned in September 2022.

The transition to a full BEV fleet is a strategic move to reduce heat load and ventilation requirements, leading to lower capital expenditure and power consumption for the ventilation system.
