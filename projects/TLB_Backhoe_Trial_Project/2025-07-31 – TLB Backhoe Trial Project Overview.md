# TLB Backhoe Trial Project Overview

## Project Summary
**Equipment**: Modified Caterpillar 444 Backhoe Loader with H80S hammer attachment  
**Purpose**: 6-month proof-of-concept trial for underground mining face preparation  
**Capital Value**: R9,400,000 (approved)  
**Timeline**: 6-month trial period  

## Business Case
Current scalers cannot adequately prepare mining faces, particularly for cleaning and preparation work. The TLB backhoe loader offers enhanced capabilities for:
- Mining face preparation
- Footwall cleaning
- Enhanced operational flexibility in underground conditions

## Key Project Documents
- **Quotation**: [[2025-07-31_TLB_Quotation_444_Black_Rock_Mine.pdf]]
- **Capital Application**: [[2025-07-31_TLB_Capital_Application_Approved.pdf]] (APPROVED)
- **Technical Investigation**: [[2025-07-31_BRMO_Scaler_Investigation.pdf]]

## Technical Specifications
- **Base Unit**: Caterpillar 444 Backhoe Loader
- **Modification**: H80S hammer attachment
- **Compliance**: Underground mining certification required
- **Safety Systems**: CAS Level 9 assessment pending

## Current Issues & Actions
### Quote Discrepancies
- **ROPS/FOB Certification**: R750,000 cost to be removed due to time constraints
- **CAS Level 9**: Inclusion status unclear - requires [[Hendrik van Niekerk]] consultation

### Outstanding Tasks
- [ ] Receive revised quote (minus R750k certification costs)
- [ ] Contact [[Hendrik van Niekerk]] regarding CAS Level 9 requirements
- [ ] Confirm final specifications
- [ ] Finalize procurement timeline

## Key Stakeholders
- **Project Lead**: [[Gregory Karsten]]
- **Approver**: [[Taku, Sello]] (Engineering Manager)
- **CAS Compliance**: [[Hendrik van Niekerk]] (Hennie)
- **Supplier**: Barloworld Equipment (Contact: Jeremiah)

## Risk Assessment
- **Collision Risk**: Assessed as low risk from TMM perspective
- **Certification Timeline**: ROPS/FOB certification would delay project
- **Compliance**: CAS Level 9 requirement needs clarification

## Timeline
- **Capital Approval**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Quote Revision**: Pending
- **Final Specifications**: August 2025
- **Trial Commencement**: TBD based on delivery
