## Triple Fee-444 TLB Backhoe Loader Project

### Quote Discrepancies Identified
**Issue 1**: Previous quote included cab lowering & ROPS/FOB certification
- **Cost Impact**: ~R750,000 to be removed
- **Reason**: Time constraints for certification process
- **Action**: Requested revised quote without these items

**Issue 2**: CAS Level 9 Strata Equipment
- **Status**: Unclear if included in current proposal
- **Risk Assessment**: TLB unit considered fairly low risk from TMM collision point of view
- **Action Required**: Consult with [[Hendrik van Niekerk]] (Hennie) - CAS Projects Engineer
- **Question**: Is strata equipment required for this trial given low collision risk?

### Outstanding Items
- [ ] Receive revised TLB quote (minus R750k certification costs)
- [ ] Contact [[Hendrik van Niekerk]] (Hennie) regarding CAS Level 9 requirement for trial
- [ ] Confirm CAS Level 9 strata equipment inclusion based on Hennie's assessment
