Interactive triage processing - handle inbox items one-by-one with discussion and confirmation.

## Overview
Process every item in **00_inbox/** individually with user discussion and confirmation before taking action. This provides full control over each processing decision while maintaining systematic organization.

## Process Flow

### 1. **Scan & Inventory**
1. List all items in `00_inbox/` with basic info
2. Show total count and file types
3. Provide overview of what will be processed

### 2. **Individual Item Processing**
For each item in sequence:

#### **A. Item Analysis & Display**
- **Show Progress**: "Processing item X of Y"
- **File Info**: Name, size, type, last modified
- **Content Preview**: 
  - Text files: First 10-20 lines
  - Images: Display image with description
  - PDFs: Page count and title if available
  - Other files: File type and basic metadata

#### **B. Intelligent Suggestions**
Based on content analysis, suggest:
- **File Type Classification**: Meeting, task, idea, decision, reference, etc.
- **Destination Folder**: `projects/`, `people/`, `reference/`, etc.
- **Filename Format**: Proper `YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äì Title.md` naming
- **Task Extraction**: Any checkboxes or action items found
- **Priority Assessment**: Urgent, High, Medium, Low based on content
- **Related Items**: Connections to existing projects or people

#### **C. User Interaction**
Present options for each item:
- **‚úÖ Accept**: Proceed with suggested processing

- Extract and sync tasks to `tasks/master_task_list.md`  
- Create person notes in `people/` if needed
- Create project folders if they don't exist
- Add proper tagging and linking

### 3. **Safety & Error Handling**
- **Never overwrite** existing files (add numeric suffix)
- **Always confirm** before deleting anything
- **Validate destinations** before moving files
- **Handle binary files** appropriately (images, PDFs, etc.)
- **Preserve original timestamps** when possible

### 4. **Media File Handling**
Special processing for media files following existing triage rules:

#### **Images/Videos/Audio** (`*.jpg *.png *.gif *.webp *.m4a *.wav *.mp3 *.mp4 *.mov *.avi *.mkv`)
- Rename: `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_<slug>.<ext>`
- Move to: `media/<type>/<YYYY>/`
- Create companion note with:
  - Front-matter with MediaType tag
  - Embedded media link: `![[media/<type>/<YYYY>/<file>]]`
  - Auto-generated summary
  - Proper tagging and linking
- **Audio files**: Offer transcription option

### 5. **Completion Summary**
After processing all items, provide:
